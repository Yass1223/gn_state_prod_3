# SoccerNet Game State Reconstruction — clean pipeline

A single, rigorously-scoped GSR pipeline. One entry config, one path, no alternative
backends: every file in this repository belongs to the active pipeline.

```
bbox_detector -> track -> crop_filter -> calibration -> pitch_gate -> tracklet_split
              -> team_embed -> jersey_number_detect -> traj_refine -> role_team -> tracklet_agg -> audit
```

| Stage | Implementation | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `bbox_detector` | YOLO11-L SoccerNet fine-tune | imgsz 1280, conf floor 0.1 (`>=`), RGB→BGR fix |
| `track` | BoT-SORT · SOF + OSNet-AIN (boxmot) | calls boxmot's `BotSort` directly with injected embeddings and external SOF camera motion; per-frame diagnostics sidecar for the audit |
| `crop_filter` | single / multi label per detection, tracked-only rule | rT ≤ 0.25, rB < 0.40; only boxes carrying a `track_id` may make another box multi; every detection gets `crop_single`/`crop_rT`/`crop_rB`/`crop_trigger`; no detection is removed |
| `tracklet_split` | DBSCAN tracklet splitting (SPLIT ONLY), after the gate | same OSNet-AIN as the tracker (shared module, same checkpoint pin and precision, audit-enforced); runs on on-pitch tracklets only; per tracklet, DBSCAN over ALL detections; noise attaches to the nearest clean-only centroid; all-multi fragments dissolve into the nearest remaining fragment; `eps 0.2, min_samples 5`, deliberately NO merge threshold (the pipeline's one merge is `traj_refine`); every tracked detection stays assigned; the incoming id is kept in `track_id_presplit`; per-sequence sidecar for the audit |
| `calibration` | **BroadTrack** (EVS, WACV'25) | temporal camera tracking + image-to-pitch; replaces pitch localization, camera calibration and projection in one stage |
| `pitch_gate` | off-pitch tracklet gate on the mean projected position | per final `track_id`, the mean of `bbox_pitch` (bottom-middle) over the rows with a finite projection; off-pitch iff `abs(mean_x) > 52.5 + margin_m` or `abs(mean_y) > 34 + margin_m`; the rows of an off-pitch tracklet lose their `track_id` (NaN, so no later stage and no export sees them), the original id stays in `track_id_pregate`; `enabled` switch (off = columns and sidecar still written, `track_id` untouched); `margin_m 3.5` untuned; a tracklet without a projection is kept; no detection is removed; per-sequence sidecar for the audit |
| `team_embed` | `osnet_team` embeddings + TEAM CLUSTERING per fragment | OSNet x1.0 (128×64, 256-d, fp32 + flip TTA), ≤ 16 sampled SINGLE crops per fragment on the stride-5 grid (a fragment with no single crop gets no embedding); fragment descriptor = L2-normalised median; `kmeans2_threshold`: 2-means over the descriptors + robust MAD distance threshold (`outlier_k 3.25`) leaves kit outliers — referees, odd kits — UNCLUSTERED; writes `team_cluster` (anonymous 0/1 or NaN) and `team_cluster_nearest` (pre-threshold nearest centroid, the role stage's fallback); no left/right naming and no roles here |
| `jersey_number_detect` | **jn_pipeline_gsr** | fragment-level, single crops only (`crop_single`); eligibility = at least one single crop, NO role filter (roles do not exist yet; the legibility filter discards referee crops): legibility → DBNet++ ROI → PARSeq + SATRN on the same crops → vote_pool (pooled per-frame majority vote); multi-GPU workers |
| `traj_refine` | cluster- and number-aware trajectory refinement (the pipeline's ONE merge) | same OSNet-AIN pin as `tracklet_split` (audit-enforced); labels per fragment: team CLUSTER id + jersey number, every fragment in scope; phase 2a merges same-number fragments with non-contradicting clusters (clean frame sets disjoint, re-enter consistent, distance ≤ `tau 0.60`) and resolves same-time number conflicts; phase 2b merges agglomeratively under clean-frame disjointness, re-enter consistency, cluster agreement and number agreement (each applying only when both sides know it; same-cluster different-known-numbers never merge); stage 3 then enforces one detection per (frame, trajectory): clean wins, held multi crops are placed into the nearest trajectory with a free slot — the receiving trajectory's centroid recomputed after every assignment — or unassigned (`track_id` NaN); snapshots in `track_id_prerefine` + jersey/cluster columns; per-sequence sidecar for the audit |
| `role_team` | per-TRAJECTORY roles and sides, AFTER the merge (`sn_gamestate/team/role_team_api.py`) | on finished trajectories: assistants by the touchline rule (one per side), goalkeepers by penalty-area depth (one per half, unclustered near-equal-depth second confirmed), the MAIN referee = an unclustered trajectory whose sampled y-range stays inside the symmetric 0.9-band of the trajectory means (rule 2.14), nearest to the assistants; everyone else a player; the two clusters are named left/right by the keeper/quantile/mean cue chain over player mean-x; an unclustered player takes its nearest centroid's side, a no-embedding player its mean-x half (both flagged); "appearance outlier" = unclustered; geometry thresholds carried from the notebook's tuning, untuned on this pipeline; per-sequence sidecar for the audit |
| `tracklet_agg` | majority vote | `[jersey_number]` (role/team are per-trajectory from the post-refine `role_team`) |
| `audit` | per-component verdicts | read-only last stage: PASS/WARN/FAIL per component per sequence → `audit/<seq>.json`; `scripts/verify_run_integrity.py` refuses the run on any FAIL |

The jersey stage recognises every fragment holding at least one single crop — there is
no role filter (roles are assigned after `traj_refine`; the legibility filter is what
discards referee crops) — and, with `single_crops_only: true` (the default), hands the
recognisers only the
single crops of a fragment (`crop_single`); overlapping crops are excluded and a fragment with
no single crop stays unnumbered. Team plays no part in it.
The refinement and role stages ignore multi crops until stage 3, as the notebook did. There is no `reid` (prtreid)
stage: the team cluster comes from `team_embed`, roles and sides from the post-refine `role_team`, and the tracker, `tracklet_split`
and `traj_refine` use OSNet-AIN. `interpolation` is kept as a module for tracking-only experiments but is not
in the pipeline (synthesized rows would carry neither crop labels nor team embeddings).

### The `tracklet_split` stage

Stage 1 of the refinement method and split only
(`sn_gamestate/track/tracklet_split.py`, algorithm; `tracklet_split_api.py`, stage). Per
tracklet, DBSCAN (`eps 0.2`, `min_samples 5`, precomputed cosine distance) over ALL its
detections breaks a tracklet holding more than one identity into fragments; noise points
-- single or multi crop -- attach to the fragment with the nearest clean-only centroid;
fragments holding only multi-player detections are dissolved, detection by detection,
into the nearest remaining fragment. Fragments become the new trajectories; every tracked
detection stays assigned and the incoming id is kept per row in `track_id_presplit`.
There is deliberately no merging and no merge threshold in this stage: the pipeline's one
merge is `traj_refine`, which runs after `team_embed` and `jersey_number_detect` so every
merge decision can use team-cluster and jersey-number evidence, and the run audit FAILS the run
if merging evidence appears in the splitter's config or sidecar.

`eps` and `min_samples` are the notebook splitter's operating point (the retired
split_merge stage ran the same split with these values), tuned on the embeddings held in
the notebook's Kaggle export. Whether that export was produced by the checkpoint pinned in
`modules/tracklet_split/tracklet_split.yaml` (`Ynniss/osnet_ain/best_ain_full.zip`) cannot
be verified from this repository; if it was not, `eps` (and `traj_refine`'s `tau`, which
lives on the same cosine-distance scale) do not transfer and must be re-tuned. The stage
writes `audit/tracklet_split/<seq>.json` (settings, embedder digest, per-tracklet split
report, output counts); the audit stage checks it against the config and against the
detections (every tracked row assigned, one detection per frame per fragment, every
fragment from exactly one source tracklet via `track_id_presplit`).

There is **no `pitch` stage**: BroadTrack runs its own keypoint (NBJW) and line (TVCalib)
detectors internally and emits camera parameters directly.

### The `pitch_gate` stage

The detector is a single-class person model and no stage before `calibration` can tell
a bench player, a steward or a photographer from an athlete, so without this stage every
tracklet is exported and receives a role. `pitch_gate`
(`sn_gamestate/pitch_gate/pitch_gate_api.py`) runs directly after `calibration` and
BEFORE `tracklet_split`, so the splitter never works on off-pitch tracklets. Per incoming `track_id` it takes the mean of the projected bottom-middle
points over the rows that carry a finite `bbox_pitch` and calls the tracklet off-pitch when
`|mean_x| > 52.5 + margin_m` or `|mean_y| > 34 + margin_m` (105 x 68 m pitch, metres,
centre at the origin). The tracklet mean is used rather than a per-frame test so that
projection error at the far touchline cannot flicker single frames of an on-pitch player.
With `enabled: true` the rows of an off-pitch tracklet get `track_id` NaN: the evaluation
export drops them and the splitter, `team_embed`, the jersey stage, `traj_refine`, `role_team`, `tracklet_agg` and the
radar never see them, so the team clustering and the role rules run on
on-pitch tracklets only. With `enabled: false` `track_id` is untouched. Either way the stage
writes `track_id_pregate` (the id the tracker left), `pitch_gate_offpitch` (the rule's
outcome), `pitch_mean_x` / `pitch_mean_y` and a sidecar `audit/pitch_gate/<seq>.json`; no
detection row is deleted and a tracklet without any projection is kept.

`margin_m` (`configs/modules/pitch_gate/pitch_gate.yaml`, default 3.5 m) is untuned: it is
an assumption meant to absorb projection error at the touchline and players a step outside
it (throw-ins, retrieving a ball) while still gating the benches and the area behind the
goals. Sweep it on the **valid** split; the audit records how many tracklets were gated
per sequence and warns when the share is implausibly high (a calibration problem rather
than off-pitch people). `tracklab -cn soccernet modules.pitch_gate.cfg.enabled=false` runs
the pipeline without the gate (the stage still writes its columns and sidecar), which is
how its contribution is attributed with `scripts/reference_metrics.py`.

## Why BroadTrack

On the sn-gamestate test split (WACV'25 paper, Table 1): JaC₅ **56.88** vs 37.14 for NBJW,
MRE **5.02 px** vs 10.28, completeness **100 %** vs 93.67. Radial-distortion modelling is
the dominant term — and the projection path here honours it (`unproject_point_on_planeZ0`
undistorts by default).

The binary writes a camera for every frame, including frames on which it lost track
(`score < 0.3` in its `main.cpp`; after more than 5 such frames it falls back to the position
prior). Those cameras are recorded with their low `score`, so the calibration stage rejects
frames below `min_score` (0.3, the binary's own threshold) and reuses the last accepted camera
for them; otherwise every player of such a frame is projected with a meaningless camera, which
propagates through `bbox_pitch` into the pitch gate, the role/team rules and, via `role`, the
jersey stage. The audit reports the share of rejected frames per sequence
(`calib_lost_frames_warn`).

## Install

```bash
uv venv --python 3.9 .venv
uv pip install --python .venv -e .
```

Two stages run as subprocesses in their own environments and need one-off provisioning
(both Docker-free — they work on Kaggle and Lightning.ai, which give a root shell with CUDA):

```bash
bash scripts/setup_broadtrack.sh   # C++ binary + LFS weights, built natively
JN_SRC=/path/to/jn_pipeline_gsr bash scripts/setup_jn_gsr.sh   # python 3.10 venv + weights
```

Everything else downloads at runtime: the detector from Hugging Face (`${hf:...}`
resolver), the tracker/tracklet_split/traj_refine OSNet-AIN checkpoint from Hugging Face with an enforced
sha256 pin (`sn_gamestate/reid/osnet_ain.py`; export `HF_TOKEN` if a repo is private),
and the team-appearance checkpoint `Ynniss/osnet_team/osnet_team_best.pt`
(`sn_gamestate/reid/osnet_team.py`; `team_sha256` in `modules/team_embed/osnet_team.yaml`
is unset until the first verified run records the digest — pin it then).

For the verified Kaggle procedure (disk layout, environment rules, timings, one-sequence
recipe) and every error observed on the way there, see
[`docs/KAGGLE_GUIDE.md`](docs/KAGGLE_GUIDE.md).

Download fallbacks (automatic, no flags needed):

* **Dataset.** `scripts/lightning_eval.sh` and `preflight_cpu.sh` download each split
  from the SoccerNet server (KAUST) first; if the server errors, does not respond, or
  leaves a truncated zip, they fall back to the official Hugging Face mirror
  [`SoccerNet/SN-GSR-2024`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SoccerNet/SN-GSR-2024)
  (same `train/valid/test/challenge.zip` files) and unzip straight from the
  huggingface_hub cache.
* **BroadTrack sources.** The EVS clone now retries 3x (no credential prompts) and falls
  back to the GitHub tarball endpoint (`main`, then `master`); optionally set
  `BT_SRC_FALLBACK_REPO` to a **private** Hugging Face repo holding
  `broadtrack_src.tar.gz` as a third path. (Observed on Kaggle: GitHub transiently
  refusing anonymous git-over-HTTPS from shared IPs.)
* **BroadTrack weights.** `scripts/setup_broadtrack.sh` pulls the two TorchScript models
  from EVS's git-lfs first; if the pull fails or leaves pointer stubs, it fetches them
  from `BT_WEIGHTS_FALLBACK_REPO` (default `Ynniss/calibiration_weights`) on Hugging
  Face. `BT_WEIGHTS_REPO` still skips EVS entirely; `BT_WEIGHTS_DIR` reads them from
  disk (e.g. a Kaggle dataset).

### Python version on Kaggle / Lightning

`pyproject.toml` pins `requires-python = ">=3.9,<3.10"` because of `torch==1.13.1`, which
publishes no wheels for interpreters newer than 3.10. Hosted notebook images generally ship
a **newer** interpreter than that, so the venv must be built against a *provisioned* 3.9 —
never against the image's own `python`. Check the image first, then provision:

```bash
python -V                                  # the image's interpreter, for the record
uv python install 3.9                      # standalone CPython; no root, no apt
uv venv --python 3.9 .venv && uv pip install --python .venv -e .
.venv/bin/python -c "import sys, torch; print(sys.version, torch.__version__, torch.cuda.is_available())"
```

The last line is the gate: it must print `3.9.x`, `1.13.1`, and `True` on a GPU box. If a
future image makes a provisioned 3.9 impossible, the alternative is widening the pin set
(`requires-python` **and** the `torch` pin together) and re-validating — not silently
running on whatever the image provides, which would change the numbers.

## Run

```bash
tracklab -cn soccernet                     # 1 clip by default (dataset.nvid)
tracklab -cn soccernet dataset.nvid=-1     # full split
bash scripts/lightning_eval.sh             # end-to-end runner (download + setup + eval)
```

Numerical precision: fp16, baked in (no switch). The detector runs ultralytics `half`,
and the OSNet-AIN embedder in `track` + `tracklet_split` + `traj_refine` runs under torch autocast on CUDA with
fp32 outputs; the `team_embed` stage runs fp32 with flip TTA, as the notebook it reproduces. Validated against fp32 on the Kaggle
5-sequence test run: tracking HOTA 71.61 (fp16) vs 71.08 (fp32), GS-HOTA 64.98 vs
64.70, calibration bit-identical - deltas inside the observed run-to-run noise (measured
with the former GTA-Link stage in the tracklet-refinement slot). The audit fails any run in
which `track`, `tracklet_split` and `traj_refine` pin different checkpoints.

GPU use: the jersey stage auto-detects GPUs via `nvidia-smi` and shards tracklets across
all of them (2 workers on Kaggle 2×T4, 4 on Lightning 4×T4, 1 otherwise). BroadTrack and
the jersey stage both cache per sequence, so re-runs skip recomputation — the jersey cache
is keyed on a content hash covering the tracklet manifest, `legibility_thr` and the sha256
of both recogniser checkpoints (PARSeq and SATRN), so retuning tracking, moving the gate, or
staging a different checkpoint under the same filename each invalidate it automatically.
The jersey consolidation rule is fixed to `vote_pool` (see
`plugins/jn_gsr/README.md` for the measured GT-box numbers and their caveats).

## Experimental switches (not in the production path)

| Flag | Default | On means | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| `modules.interpolation.cfg.enabled` | `false` | fill tracklet gaps of `1 < dt < n_dti` frames by linear interpolation (`n_dti`, `n_min` — untuned) | `configs/modules/interpolation/dti.yaml` |
| detector + tracker conf floor | `0.1` / `0.1` | lowering **both** to `0.05` is the only way to make BoT-SORT's BYTE low band non-empty; an A/B, not a code change | `bbox_detector` `min_confidence` + `track_low_thresh` |

The GTA-Link tuning tool (`scripts/tune_gta_kaggle.py`) was removed with the GTA-Link
stage. `tracklet_split` has two parameters (`eps`, `min_samples` in
`configs/modules/tracklet_split/tracklet_split.yaml`) and `traj_refine` carries the
pipeline's only merge threshold (`tau` in `configs/modules/traj_refine/traj_refine.yaml`);
re-tuning them means re-running the
notebook's sweep on embeddings produced by the pinned checkpoint, on the **valid** split.
`test` is reserved for the frozen production run.

> `interpolation` is not in the production pipeline. `interpolation.enabled=true`
> synthesizes detection rows that carry neither crop labels nor team embeddings; that is
> fine for tracking metrics but not for the role/team stage.

## Verify before you measure

Every run ends with the `audit` stage (`sn_gamestate/audit/run_audit_api.py`): for each
sequence and each component it records what the component was supposed to produce, what
was observed, and a verdict. Neither BroadTrack nor the jersey stage aborts on failure,
so without this a run can finish with empty pitch coordinates or empty jersey numbers and
still print plausible metrics. The crop filter, team-embedding and role/team stages are
checked against what their configs declare: labels must agree with the stored overlap
ratios at the configured thresholds, the `tracklet_split` sidecar must record the configured
`eps`/`min_samples` and checkpoint digest with NO merge threshold anywhere, its per-tracklet
split counts must be
consistent with each other and with the final `track_id`s (every tracked row assigned, one
detection per frame per fragment, every fragment from one source tracklet), the `pitch_gate` sidecar must record
the configured switch and margin, its mean positions and off-pitch flags must equal the
ones recomputed from `bbox_pitch`, and `track_id` must have been cleared on off-pitch
tracklets if and only if the gate is enabled (the tracklet_split, crop_filter and calibration
checks compare against the pre-gate ids in `track_id_pregate`), every tracklet must carry a team embedding, the
checkpoint digest and the rule parameters that ran (per-sequence sidecars under
`audit/team_embed/`, `audit/role_team/`) must equal the configured ones, every tracked
row must have a valid role, players/keepers a side and referees none. The jersey check is the strictest: the per-sequence cache
blob must carry `rule = vote_pool`, the sha256 of both staged checkpoints and the
`single_crops_only` value that ran (equal to the config), its manifest counts must equal
the eligible tracklets and their single crops in the state, it must answer every
player/goalkeeper tracklet that holds a single crop, no number may sit on a tracklet without
one, the columns must agree with the blob, and the provisioning
provenance of SATRN and PARSeq must be on record. Thresholds are in
`configs/modules/audit/run_audit.yaml`.

```bash
python scripts/verify_run_integrity.py --expect-sequences 49   # exits non-zero on any FAIL
```

The radar (minimap) draws only tracked rows with a team or referee colour. Untracked
detections and tracklets without a team are not painted in a neutral colour; the audit
reports how many rows were skipped for that reason (`visualization (radar)` check).

The BroadTrack → sn-calibration parameter conversion includes a distortion rescale derived
from the C++ source. Confirm it on real output before trusting any metric:

```bash
python scripts/verify_broadtrack_conversion.py -c broadtrack_calib/SNGS-116.json \
    -f data/SoccerNetGS/test/SNGS-116/img1 -o broadtrack_check
```

Checks: model equivalence against an independent reimplementation (< 0.01 px), Z=0
roundtrip (< 1 cm), pitch-wireframe overlay (must sit on the painted lines), frame coverage.

## Reference metrics

Computed and stored **separately** from the pipeline's own eval output:

```bash
# TrackLab saves the state INSIDE the Hydra run directory (verified on the Kaggle run
# of 2026-09-02), so point --state at the newest one:
python scripts/reference_metrics.py \
    --state "$(ls -t outputs/sn-gamestate/*/*/states/sn-gamestate.pklz | head -1)" \
    --dataset-path data/SoccerNetGS --eval-set test --out reference_metrics
```

| Block | Metrics | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `tracking` | HOTA, DetA, AssA, MOTA, IDF1, IDSW | pipeline evaluator, image space, attributes off |
| `gsr` | GS-HOTA, GS-DetA, GS-AssA, GS-IDF1 | same evaluator, pitch space, attributes on, 5 m tolerance |
| `jersey_number` | det_acc_all, precision, recall, F1, trk_acc_all, trk_acc_numbered | Hungarian IoU ≥ 0.5, unnumbered = −1 |
| `calibration` | JaC5, JaC10, MRE, MedRE, CR | official sn-calibration protocol at 960×540, mirror-aware |

Pass several `--state/--label` pairs to get a comparison table (`summary.md`) — that is how
per-stage contributions (e.g. `traj_refine` enabled vs disabled) are attributed.
