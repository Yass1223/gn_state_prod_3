"""Unit tests for sn_gamestate/refine/traj_refine.py (pure numpy, no GPU).

Five-phase merger: phases 1-4 run one identical agglomerative procedure on the
pools by arrival labels (S1 cluster+number, S2 cluster, S3 number, S4 neither),
each in isolation; phase 5 pools everything. Number-conflict resolution runs in
phases 1, 3 and 5, to a fixpoint before each agglomerative pass. Synthetic
embeddings: orthogonal-ish unit vectors per identity, so distances between
same-identity clusters are ~0 and between different identities ~1.
Run directly (``python tests/test_traj_refine.py``) or under pytest.
