"""Linear interpolation of tracklet gaps (official BoT-SORT ``tools/interpolation.py``).

The official BoT-SORT release ships DTI (disconnected track interpolation) as a
separate offline step. It fills short gaps inside a finished
tracklet by linearly interpolating the box between the detections that bracket
the gap, which recovers detections lost to occlusion and raises DetA/recall
without touching association.

Semantics (from the official script)
------------------------------------
Per final ``track_id``, walk the tracklet's detections in temporal order; for
each consecutive pair whose frame gap ``dt`` satisfies ``1 < dt < n_dti``, insert
``dt - 1`` rows whose ``bbox_ltwh`` is the linear blend of the bracketing boxes.
Only tracklets with at least ``n_min`` real detections are interpolated. Two
deliberate departures from the official script, both specified for this pipeline:
``n_min`` is inclusive (``>= n_min``, the script uses ``>``), and interpolated
rows carry the mean ``bbox_conf`` of their two endpoints rather than a hard 1.0,
so a synthesized box never outranks the real detections around it.

Frames are ordered by the *rank* of ``image_id`` in the video's frame list rather
than by raw ``image_id`` arithmetic, and every synthesized row is placed on an
``image_id`` that actually exists in ``metadatas``. Downstream stages resolve a
frame path by ``image_id``, so a synthesized row must never point at a frame that
is not there.

What downstream stages require of a synthesized row (audited, 2026-08-06)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pipeline order was ``bbox_detector -> reid -> track -> gta_link -> [here] ->
calibration -> jersey_number_detect -> tracklet_agg -> team -> team_side``
(``gta_link`` has since been replaced by ``split_merge``).
``reid`` runs BEFORE ``track``, so a row created here can never have the columns
``reid`` produces (``embeddings``, ``visibility_scores``, ``body_masks``,
``role_detection``, ``role_confidence``).

* ``calibration`` (``BroadTrackCalibration``) — needs ``bbox_ltwh``, ``image_id``.
  Satisfied; synthesized rows are projected to ``bbox_pitch`` like any other.
* ``jersey_number_detect`` (``JNGsrTrackletRecognizer``) — needs ``track_id``,
  ``bbox_ltwh``, ``image_id``, ``role_detection``. The role filter uses
  ``grp["role_detection"].mode()``, which skips NaN, so the tracklet's real
  detections still decide the role and the synthesized crops are ordinary image
  regions. Satisfied.
* ``tracklet_agg`` (``MajorityVoteTracklet``) — votes per ``track_id`` and writes
  the winner to every row of the tracklet, so synthesized rows receive ``role``
  and ``jersey_number`` from their tracklet. Satisfied.
* ``team`` (``TrackletTeamClustering``) — **NOT satisfied.** It runs
  ``np.mean(np.vstack(group.embeddings.values), axis=0)`` over each tracklet.
  With one embedding-less row in the group, ``np.vstack`` raises
  ``ValueError: all the input array dimensions except for the concatenation axis
  must match exactly, but along dimension 1, the array at index 0 has size 512
  and the array at index 1 has size 1``.
* ``team_side`` — needs ``team_cluster``, ``bbox_pitch``, ``role``; all derived
  per tracklet. Satisfied.

Status after the role/team rework
---------------------------------
The audit above describes the pipeline at 2026-08-06 (prtreid ``reid``, k-means
``team``, ``team_side``). Those stages are gone: role and team now come from
``crop_filter`` (runs before ``split_merge``), ``team_embed`` and ``role_team``. A
synthesized row carries no ``crop_single``/``crop_rT``/``crop_rB`` and no
``team_embedding``, so the module is NOT in ``soccernet.yaml``'s ``pipeline:``; it is
kept as a module only for tracking-only experiments.

Consequence, and why this module still exists
---------------------------------------------
The tracking-metrics path is unaffected: ``scripts/reference_metrics.py
--skip gsr jersey_number calibration`` needs only ``track_id``, ``bbox_ltwh`` and
``image_id``, and a state that stops after this stage never reaches ``team``.
That is the scoring path a tracking-only experiment uses, so the stage can be
swept in place with ``enabled: true`` and no other change.

Turning it on in the FULL pipeline additionally requires ``team`` to tolerate
rows without ``embeddings`` (drop them from the tracklet mean, or carry the
nearest real embedding forward). That is a separate decision and is deliberately
NOT made here; enabling the flag logs a warning naming the constraint.
