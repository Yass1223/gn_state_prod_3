"""BoT-SORT with sparse-optical-flow camera motion, as the reference notebook runs it.

What this is
------------
boxmot's `BotSort` driven from the tracklab pipeline, with appearance supplied from
outside. It replaces a subclass of tracklab's bundled `bot_sort` fork, which is a
different tracker: its first association is the JDE/FairMOT recipe
`fuse_motion(kf, cosine, lambda_=0.985)` with the paper's `min(gated IoU, gated
appearance)` block commented out, so `proximity_thresh` and `appearance_thresh` are
inert there. Rather than re-derive boxmot's behaviour on top of the fork, this module
calls boxmot.

Three inversions of control, all deliberate and all matching the reference:

* **Embeddings are injected.** `reid_model` is a guard object that raises if the
  tracker ever tries to compute its own, and features are passed to `update()`. Only
  detections above `track_high_thresh` are embedded; the rest carry a zero row, which
  is what the first association gate sees for them.
* **Camera motion is computed outside.** One `SOF` instance per video, called once per
  frame, its warp handed to the tracker through a feed object installed as `cmc`. The
  constructor is checked to have built a real `SOF` before the feed replaces it, so a
  wrong `cmc_method` fails loudly instead of silently disabling compensation.
* **No confidence pre-filter.** boxmot's own split is the only floor. The detector's
  `conf` already floors at 0.1 and `track_low_thresh` is below that, so an extra
  `min_confidence` gate would be a second, redundant threshold.

Two details that are easy to get wrong
--------------------------------------
`tracklab.utils.cv2.cv2_load_image` returns **RGB**. boxmot's `BaseCMC.preprocess`
does `COLOR_BGR2GRAY` and the OSNet-AIN preprocessing does `COLOR_BGR2RGB`, so both
expect BGR. The frame is converted once, here, and the BGR array is what everything
downstream sees.

boxmot returns `[x1, y1, x2, y2, id, conf, cls, det_ind]`. Confidence is column 5 and
the class is column 6 — the reverse of the tracklab fork's output, where reading
column 6 as confidence would silently write class ids into `track_bbox_conf`.

Camera motion, for the record
-----------------------------
boxmot 19's `SOF.apply(img, dets)` accepts `dets` and never reads it: all three
`goodFeaturesToTrack` calls pass `mask=None`, and `BaseCMC.generate_mask` is never
called. The reference notebook additionally passes `None`. So the camera motion here is
estimated on unmasked keypoints, players included, and `scale=0.15` means the estimate
runs on a frame downsampled to 15% with the translation divided back up.

Inherited contract
------------------
`preprocess`, the collate function and the dataloader all come from tracklab's
`BotSORT` wrapper, which is why that class is still the base. The one thing assumed
about it and not verified here is that its `__init__` only stores `cfg`/`device` and
calls `reset()`; if it also reads `cfg.model_weights`, this will fail at construction
naming that key.

    whether every frame actually reached the tracker. Without a record, an audit can only
    report those as unresolved, so they are written through to a sidecar on every frame
    and the in-pipeline `audit` stage reads them back. Write-through, not end-of-video:
    each video passes through every stage - the audit included - before the tracker
    sees the next video, so anything buffered until the next video (or process exit)
    would reach disk only after the audit that needs it (observed on Kaggle: 5/5
    sequences failed with "no tracker sidecar" while tracking itself was healthy).

    Writing is best-effort: a failure here degrades the audit, and must never take down
    a tracking run.
