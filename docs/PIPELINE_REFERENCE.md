# SoccerNet Game State Reconstruction — pipeline reference (repo_prod_v1)

Reference date: 2026-09-05. Derived from direct inspection of the repository
(configs, source, scripts), not from the README alone, and validated by an end-to-end
Kaggle run on one test sequence (see §7 findings and `docs/KAGGLE_GUIDE.md`). Extended
2026-09-03 with the `traj_refine` stage, the jersey candidate output (blob schema 2),
and the second detector (YOLOv11L_HM, now the default). Restructured 2026-09-04 to the
split-only architecture (`split_merge` retired, `tracklet_split` + one merge in
`traj_refine`), exercised live in runs 7 and 8 (§7 items 18–19). **Restructured again
2026-09-04 (later the same day) to the CLUSTER-FIRST architecture** (§8 batch 7): the
pipeline order changed (calibration/gate before the splitter; role/side assignment
moved AFTER the merge), `team_embed` now clusters fragments into anonymous TEAM
CLUSTERS, `traj_refine` merges on cluster + number evidence, and `role_team` assigns
roles and sides per finished trajectory (assistants, goalkeepers, main referee by
rule (2.14), cluster→side naming). Not yet exercised on Kaggle (§9).
Intended to
be pasted into any working context as the ground-truth description of the pipeline, so the
repository does not need to be re-analyzed each time. Statements are marked **[verified]**
(read directly from code/config or observed at runtime), **[assumption]** (design intent,
not independently confirmed), or **[unverified]** (not yet exercised). The GitHub remote
is `https://github.com/Yass1223/gn_state_prod_1` (main). Canonical copy:

## 1. What the repository is

A single-path SoccerNet Game State Reconstruction (GSR) pipeline built on TrackLab, with
one entry config (`sn_gamestate/configs/soccernet.yaml`) and no alternative backends.
The pipeline order **[verified]**:

```
bbox_detector -> track -> crop_filter -> calibration -> pitch_gate -> tracklet_split
             -> team_embed -> jersey_number_detect -> traj_refine -> role_team
             -> tracklet_agg -> audit
```

Order rationale **[verified from soccernet.yaml]**: calibration then the gate run
before the splitter, so the splitter never works on off-pitch tracklets; `team_embed`
(embedding + TEAM CLUSTER) and the jersey stage label the splitter's FRAGMENTS;
`traj_refine` performs the pipeline's one merge on that cluster + number evidence; and
`role_team` assigns roles and sides once, AFTER the merge, on finished trajectories —
where the temporal and positional evidence is strongest and can never gate a merge.

The bbox detector is a Hydra defaults-group choice between two YOLO11-L fine-tunes with
an identical operating point (default `yolo_ultralytics_snft_hm`; switch with
`modules/bbox_detector=yolo_ultralytics_snft`) — one path through the pipeline, one
stage module, two weight variants **[verified]**.

Package name `sn-gamestate` 1.0.0, licence GPL-3.0 (repository code). BroadTrack (EVS)
sources/weights are licensed noncommercial-research with no redistribution and are never
committed here; the binary, its weights, and generated calibration JSONs must not be
published **[verified: setup script and config comments; the licence terms themselves
are as stated by the repository, not independently reviewed]**.

## 2. Execution environments (three, by design) [verified]

| Environment | Interpreter | Used by | Provisioning |
|---|---|---|---|
| Main venv `.venv` | Python 3.9 (pinned `>=3.9,<3.10`), torch 1.13.1, numpy 1.26.4 | all pipeline stages except the two below | `uv venv --python 3.9 .venv && uv pip install --python .venv -e .` then `uv pip install --python .venv --no-deps boxmot==19.0.0` |
| Jersey venv `plugins/jn_gsr/.venv_jn` | Python 3.10, torch 2.0.1+cu118, mmcv 2.0.1 | `jersey_number_detect` (subprocess workers) | `bash scripts/setup_jn_gsr.sh` (needs the package vendored at `plugins/jn_gsr`, which it is) |
| BroadTrack native binary | C++ + libtorch 2.5.1+cu124 | `calibration` (subprocess) | `bash scripts/setup_broadtrack.sh` (clone EVS repo, apt deps, libtorch, cmake; no Docker) |

Critical environment facts **[verified from pyproject.toml / scripts]**:

* Python is pinned to 3.9 because torch 1.13.1 publishes no wheels for newer
  interpreters. Hosted images ship newer Pythons, so the venv must be built against a
  provisioned 3.9 (`uv python install 3.9`), never the image's own interpreter. Gate:
  `.venv/bin/python -c "import sys, torch; print(sys.version, torch.__version__, torch.cuda.is_available())"`
  must print `3.9.x`, `1.13.1`, `True` on GPU.
* `boxmot==19.0.0` is installed with `--no-deps` and is deliberately absent from
  `pyproject.toml` dependencies: its metadata requires torch>=2.2.1 and
  huggingface-hub>=1.7.1, which contradict the project pins. Its import chain only needs
  numpy, cv2, lap (`lapx`), scipy, rich, all already installed. Version matters: 19.x
  exposes `boxmot.trackers.botsort.botsort.BotSort`; 20+ moved it, and the 19.0.0 wheel
  misreports `__version__` as "18.0.0".
* Pins that exist to stop dependency drift: `setuptools<81` (pkg_resources removal vs
  torchmetrics 0.10.3), `albumentations<2` (top-level `functional` export vs the
  torchreid fork), `huggingface_hub>=0.23,<1.0` (HfFolder removal), `scikit-learn<1.7`.
* torchreid is the VlSomers/bpbreid fork (git dependency); it provides `osnet_ain_x1_0`
  (tracker/tracklet_split/traj_refine embedder) and `osnet_x1_0` (team model backbone).
* An installed-TrackLab patch is required and applied by the scripts, not by the package:
  `sed -i 's/gamestate-2025/gamestate-2024/g'` on
  `tracklab/wrappers/dataset/soccernet/soccernet_game_state.py`. A fresh environment
  without this patch requests the wrong dataset task name.
* Do not use `uv run` after installation (no lock covers the boxmot side-install; `uv run`
  re-resolves and was observed to swap 12 packages). Invoke `.venv/bin/python` /
  `.venv/bin/tracklab` directly.
* `scripts/preflight_imports.py` imports every `_target_` plus the runtime-only imports
  (boxmot, shared embedder, rules) in seconds and should be run before any long job.
  `preflight_cpu.sh` audits all artifacts (paths, sizes, checksums) and fetches only what
  is missing; `CHECK_ONLY=1` audits without downloading.

## 3. Stages, configs, parameters [verified from configs and module sources]

Config root: `sn_gamestate/configs/`; per-module files under `configs/modules/<stage>/`.
`project_dir` resolves to the launch directory (`${hydra:runtime.cwd}`), so `tracklab`
must be launched from the repository root; outputs go to `outputs/sn-gamestate/<date>/<time>/`.

| Stage | `_target_` (module) | Key configuration |
|---|---|---|
| `bbox_detector` | `sn_gamestate.bbox_detector.yolo_snft_api.YOLOUltralyticsSNFT` | Defaults-group switch between two YOLO11-L fine-tunes, same module and operating point (imgsz 1280, conf floor 0.1 kept with `>=`, iou 0.7, max_det 300, RGB→BGR fix; optional TensorRT, off by default). **Default (batch 13, 2026-09-05): `yolo_ultralytics_snft_hm`** — HF `${hf:Ynniss/YOLOv11L_HM,best.zip,yolov11l_hm_best.pt}` (the 3-arg resolver form copies the download under a .pt name). Alternative: `yolo_ultralytics_snft` — `${hf:Ynniss/sn-gamestate-weights,yolov11_sn_best.pt}` (the run-4 baseline detector). Distinct `engine_path` per variant; `build_trt_engines.py` builds only the snft engine (missing engine ⇒ warn + PyTorch fallback) |
| `track` | `sn_gamestate.track.bot_sort.BotSortSOF` | boxmot BotSort called directly; embeddings injected from the shared OSNet-AIN module; SOF camera motion (scale 0.15) computed outside; thresholds: high 0.3, low 0.05, new 0.4, match 0.85, proximity 0.5, appearance 0.35, buffer 60, frame_rate 25; fp16 autocast, fp32 outputs; per-frame audit sidecar `audit/track/` |
| `crop_filter` | `sn_gamestate.crop_filter.CropFilter` | single iff rT ≤ 0.25 and rB < 0.40, contaminators must carry a track_id (`contam_mode: tracked`); writes `crop_single/crop_rT/crop_rB/crop_trigger`; removes nothing |
| `tracklet_split` | `sn_gamestate.track.tracklet_split_api.TrackletSplit` | NEW 2026-09-04, replaces `split_merge`; since batch 7 it runs AFTER the pitch gate, on on-pitch tracklets only. Stage 1 of the refinement method, SPLIT ONLY — the pipeline's one merge is `traj_refine`, and the audit FAILS on any merge threshold or merging evidence here. Per tracklet, DBSCAN (eps 0.2, min_samples 5, precomputed cosine) over ALL detections (clean and multi); noise — single or multi crop — attaches to the nearest clean-only centroid; all-multi fragments dissolve per-detection into the nearest remaining fragment; degenerate cases deterministic (small/all-noise tracklet → one fragment; all-multi tracklet keeps its DBSCAN fragments). Fragments → trajectories 1..T; every tracked row stays assigned; incoming id snapshotted per row in `track_id_presplit` (single-source-origin audit check AND, since batch 7, the gate check's "ids as the gate left them" basis); validates the tracker invariant (one detection per tracklet per frame, raises on violation); same OSNet-AIN pin as `track` (audit-enforced); sidecar `audit/tracklet_split/`; algorithm `track/tracklet_split.py` (numpy+sklearn, 12 unit tests in `tests/test_tracklet_split.py`) |
| `calibration` | `sn_gamestate.calibration.broadtrack_api.BroadTrackCalibration` | BroadTrack binary at `pretrained_models/broadtrack/`; camera prior (0, 55, −12); `min_score 0.3` rejects lost frames and reuses the last accepted camera (`use_prev_parameters: true`, `max_carry_frames 0`); per-sequence JSON cache `broadtrack_calib/` (`use_cached_json: true`); writes human-bbox masks from own detections; `staging_dir` for read-only datasets; emits camera `parameters` and `bbox_pitch` |
| `pitch_gate` | `sn_gamestate.pitch_gate.PitchGate` | enabled, margin_m 3.5 (untuned); off-pitch iff |mean_x| > 52.5+m or |mean_y| > 34+m on the tracklet mean of finite `bbox_pitch`; gated tracklets: `track_id` → NaN, original kept in `track_id_pregate`; no row deleted; sidecar `audit/pitch_gate/` |
| `team_embed` | `sn_gamestate.team.TeamEmbedding` | Since batch 7: embeddings AND the sequence's TEAM CLUSTERING. Embeds only the sampled SINGLE crops (`crop_single`) per fragment — ≤ 16 on the stride-5 grid, osnet_team (OSNet x1.0, 128×64, 256-d, fp32 + flip TTA, HF `Ynniss/osnet_team/osnet_team_best.pt`); a fragment with no single crop gets no embedding. Fragment descriptor = L2-normalised median of its embedded crops; `cluster_method: kmeans2_threshold` (config switch for variants): 2-means (the notebook's seeded k-means from `team/rules.py`), then the robust distance rule — d = Euclidean distance to the nearest centroid, m = median(d), s = MAD; UNCLUSTERED when s ≥ 0.05·m and d > m + `outlier_k`·s (outlier_k 3.25, the notebook's k) — so referees and odd kits get `team_cluster` NaN. Writes `team_cluster` (0.0/1.0/NaN, constant per fragment) and `team_cluster_nearest` (nearest centroid BEFORE the threshold, the role stage's fallback carrier). Anonymous cluster ids: no left/right naming and no roles here. `team_sha256` currently **null** (recorded, not enforced — pin after first verified run); sidecar `audit/team_embed/` (cluster block: method, sizes, m/s/s_ok, centroid gap, fragments_no_single) |
| `role_team` | `sn_gamestate.team.RoleTeamAssignment` | REWRITTEN batch 7, extended batch 11: per-TRAJECTORY roles and sides, AFTER `traj_refine` (the last labelling stage; `team/rules.py` and its notebook-equivalence test are untouched). **Batch 11: the team clustering is RECOMPUTED here, on the final trajectories** — descriptor = L2-normalised median of the trajectory's embedded crops (every merged fragment contributes), then the same `kmeans2_threshold` rule as team_embed (2-means via `rules.kmeans2` + robust MAD threshold, `outlier_k` 3.25); the recomputed `team_cluster`/`team_cluster_nearest` OVERWRITE the columns, constant per final trajectory (no embedded crop → unclustered); "appearance outlier" (= unclustered) refers to THIS clustering, and team_embed's fragment-level clustering feeds `traj_refine` only. Per sequence: geometry stats per trajectory on the stride-5 grid (mean/std x,y; q75 of \|x\|; sampled count); ASSISTANTS by the touchline rule (\|mean y\| ≥ tau_a 0.9 · clip max, y-std STRICTLY < tau_a_sy 2.0; no trajectory-length gate — batch 13 removed tau_n; one per side, and with several candidates on a side the one MOST OUTLIER from both team clusters, i.e. largest distance to its nearer recomputed 2-means centroid, ties broken by \|mean y\| and any no-embedding candidate ranked last; accepted when unclustered or by margin tau_m 0.30); GOALKEEPERS by penalty-area depth (one per half; an unclustered second candidate within gk_depth_m 4.0 of the same depth confirmed); MAIN referee (one per sequence) = among remaining UNCLUSTERED trajectories, those whose sampled y-range stays inside the symmetric band of the trajectory means — rule (2.14): max(y_ref) ≤ 0.9·max_i(mean_y_i) AND min(y_ref) ≥ 0.9·min_i(mean_y_i), band 0.9 — the candidate nearest the assistants (most-central fallback with no assistants); everyone else a player. Sides: clusters named left/right by the cue chain over player mean-x (`side_rule: keeper` — positional keeper cue, then quantile (the mean of the 20th and 80th percentiles of player mean-x, p20/p80 since batch 13), then mean; `vote` = sign/quantile/mean majority); a clustered player takes its cluster's side; an unclustered player takes its NEAREST centroid's side (`team_cluster_nearest`, flagged fallback); a player with no embedding takes its mean-x half (flagged). Geometry thresholds carried from the notebook's tuned operating point, with tau_a and tau_a_sy adjusted in batch 13; UNTUNED on this pipeline's trajectories; band/gk_depth_m are new. Sidecar `audit/role_team/` (cluster block: method/outlier_k/embedded/clustered/sizes/m/s/no_embedding + per_trajectory role/why/team/cluster + sequence_level cues/band/main_referee/fallback counts) |
| `jersey_number_detect` | `sn_gamestate.jersey.jn_gsr_api.JNGsrTrackletRecognizer` | subprocess workers in the 3.10 venv; since batch 7 eligibility = at least one single crop, NO role filter (roles do not exist yet; the legibility filter is what discards referee crops); `single_crops_only: true`; legibility > 0.72 → DBNet++ ROI → PARSeq + SATRN → `vote_pool` (the only rule); stride 5; fp16; GPU sharding auto via nvidia-smi (2 workers on Kaggle 2×T4); content-hash cache `jn_cache/`. Since 2026-09-03 (blob **schema 2**): two ADDITIVE columns for `traj_refine` — `jersey_number_candidates` (every pooled label of the two recognisers as `[label, mx, conf_sum, votes]`, ranked by the maxconf score exp(mx)·conf_sum; stats, not scores, so merged tracklets recombine exactly: mx=max, conf_sum/votes add) and `jersey_number_maxconf` (assigned number's score). The schema is folded into the cache key (old caches miss and recompute once) and checked on every shard and cached blob; the assigned number stays `vote_pool`, byte-identical. The batch-7 eligibility change alters the manifest content, so EVERY sequence's cache key changes and the entire cache recomputes once (referee fragments now enter the workers) |
| `traj_refine` | `sn_gamestate.refine.traj_refine_api.TrajRefine` | NEW 2026-09-03, extended 2026-09-04 twice (split-only conformance, then batch-7 cluster labels). The pipeline's ONE merge (Stage 2) plus stage-3 duplicate-frame resolution, between jersey and role_team. Labels per fragment: the TEAM CLUSTER id (`team_cluster`, NaN = unclustered — imposes no merge condition) and the jersey number with its pooled candidate stats; EVERY fragment is in scope (no roles exist yet). The merger is FIVE phases of ONE identical agglomerative procedure (average linkage, the splitter's distance convention): the minimum-distance pair in the pool merges while distance ≤ tau, under CLEAN-frame disjointness ∧ re-enter consistency (batch 12: the re-enter side is the frame HALF by box center, whole-frame-width rule — the earlier trajectory's exit half and the later one's entry half must match; no margin, `edge_margin` removed) ∧ cluster agreement ∧ number agreement, each label condition applying only when BOTH sides know it (two same-cluster fragments with two DIFFERENT known numbers never merge; an unclustered numbered fragment merges on same number + distance; an unclustered unnumbered fragment merges on distance alone). Fragments are pooled by the labels they ARRIVE with — S1 cluster+number, S2 cluster only, S3 number only, S4 neither — and phases 1–4 merge each pool in ISOLATION, no cross-pool pair examined before phase 5; phase 5 then pools every cluster, merged or not, and runs the same procedure once more. In phases 1, 3 and 5 (where same-number pairs are examined) a pair claiming one number at the same time (clean-frame overlap) is a conflict — the lower-maxconf side (score exp(max mx)·Σconf_sum over the pair's clean-detection stats) walks to its best candidate not previously lost (banned set; cascades; "-1"/exhaustion → unnumbered) — resolved to a FIXPOINT before each agglomerative pass, repeating while the pass still merges. Multi-player detections are ignored until stage 3. Stage 3, after the merger: 3a keeps one detection per (frame, trajectory) — clean wins (a second clean is a counted anomaly), else the multi nearest the clean-first centroid — and holds the rest; 3b places held detections in ascending distance into the nearest trajectory with that frame free, with DYNAMIC centroids — the receiving trajectory's all-detection centroid is recomputed after EVERY assignment — and unassigns the rest (`track_id` NaN, the ONLY way any refinement stage drops a row; no distance cap by specification). Same OSNet-AIN pin as track/tracklet_split (audit-enforced; tau 0.60 untuned for this stage). A merged cluster unifies `team_cluster` (the known id, or NaN); rows adopted in 3b take the target cluster's labels. Snapshots written unconditionally: `track_id_prerefine`, `jersey_number_detection_prerefine`, `jersey_number_confidence_prerefine`, `team_cluster_prerefine` (role/team snapshots are gone with the columns — roles/sides are assigned AFTER this stage); `enabled: false` = snapshots + sidecar only (the A/B switch). Output invariant: one detection per (image_id, track_id) over ALL detections; tracked rows out = in − unassigned. Sidecar `audit/traj_refine/` (incl. `stage3` block, `rows_unassigned`, per-cluster `team_cluster`); algorithm in `refine/traj_refine.py` (pure numpy, 26 unit tests in `tests/test_traj_refine.py`) |
| `tracklet_agg` | `tracklab.wrappers.MajorityVoteTracklet` | majority vote over `[jersey_number]` only (role/team are per-trajectory from the post-refine role_team) |
| `audit` | `sn_gamestate.audit.RunAudit` | read-only last stage; per-sequence, per-component PASS/WARN/FAIL to `audit/<seq>.json`; cross-checks every sidecar against the composed config (including track vs tracklet_split checkpoint-pin equality); `scripts/verify_run_integrity.py` exits non-zero on any FAIL. Batch-7 basis map (the snapshot chain of the new order): `track_id_pregate` = TRACKER ids (basis for the track, crop_filter and calibration checks); `track_id_presplit` = the gate's output (basis for the gate's id comparison); `track_id_prerefine` = FRAGMENT ids as the splitter left them (basis for the tracklet_split, team_embed and jersey checks); final `track_id` = trajectories (basis for the role_team, traj_refine-output and tracklet_agg checks). `_check_team_embed` validates the clustering: cluster_method/outlier_k ran == configured, sizes sum to clustered, per-fragment cluster constancy and {0,1} values recomputed from the columns — on the pre-refine basis the cluster column is read from the `team_cluster_prerefine` SNAPSHOT when present, since traj_refine legitimately rewrites the live column (run-9 false-FAIL fix, batch 8) — clustered count == sidecar, `team_cluster_nearest` on every embedded fragment, missing embeddings == `fragments_no_single`. `_check_role_team` audits the FINAL trajectories directly (role_team is the last labelling stage — the batch-6 snapshot machinery is retired with the snapshots themselves): roles/sides valid and constant, referees sideless, both teams present, ≤ 1 main_2.14 referee, ≤ 2 assistants, keeper caps, fallback counts consistent with the per-trajectory reasons (half fallback ⇒ WARN), params want ⊆ ran, sidecar covers every trajectory. `_check_jersey` eligibility = single-crop presence (no role filter). The `traj_refine` check does row accounting (rows losing an id == sidecar `rows_unassigned`, no row may gain one, tracked_after == tracked_before − unassigned) with the pin-equality key `ain_sha256_tracklet_split` and number/`team_cluster` constancy per final track |

Not in the pipeline **[verified]**: no `pitch` stage (BroadTrack runs NBJW keypoints and
TVCalib lines internally); no `reid`/prtreid stage; `interpolation` (dti.yaml) exists as a
module with `enabled: false` and is excluded from `pipeline:` because synthesized rows
carry no crop labels or team embeddings.

Precision policy **[verified]**: fp16 baked in for the detector (ultralytics half) and the
OSNet-AIN embedder (autocast, fp32 outputs); team_embed is fp32 + flip TTA; BroadTrack and
the jersey venv are out of scope by construction. Reported fp16-vs-fp32 validation numbers
(HOTA 71.61 vs 71.08, GS-HOTA 64.98 vs 64.70) are repository claims from a prior run
**[unverified here]**.

## 4. External artifacts: exactly where every download comes from

All verified against the fetching code, not the README.

The .zip IS the torch checkpoint **[verified on Kaggle run 5, 2026-09-03: resolver downloaded it, ultralytics loaded it under torch 1.13.1, bbox_detector audit PASS]**; ~48.5 MB fp16 ultralytics YOLO11 DetectionModel |
| OSNet-AIN `best_ain_full.zip` (tracker + tracklet_split + traj_refine) | HF `Ynniss/osnet_ain`, revision `d78f65de…`, the packed file is itself a torch.save archive | exploded snapshot `Ynniss/osnet_ain_ckp` path exists in code (used when `ain_file` is cleared); `ain_local_path` reads from disk | **sha256 enforced** (`a0a7e426…`); audit fails on any pin mismatch among the three stages |
| Team model `osnet_team_best.pt` | HF `Ynniss/osnet_team` | `team_local_path` | sha256 **recorded only** (`team_sha256: null`) — pin after first verified run |
| BroadTrack source code | `github.com/evs-broadcast/BroadTrack` git clone, 3 attempts, no credential prompts (LFS smudge off) | GitHub codeload tarball (`main` verified live, then `master`); optional third path `BT_SRC_FALLBACK_REPO` = private HF repo with `broadtrack_src.tar.gz` (added 2026-09-02 after Kaggle observed GitHub refusing anonymous git-over-HTTPS transiently) | `CMakeLists.txt` presence; tarball trees carry `SOURCE_SNAPSHOT.txt` |
| BroadTrack weights `nbjw_keypoint_model`, `tvcalib_model` (~230–266 MB TorchScript each) | EVS git-lfs (`git lfs pull`) | **automatic HF fallback** to `BT_WEIGHTS_FALLBACK_REPO` (default `Ynniss/calibiration_weights`, .zip torch.jit containers staged by copy) when the pull fails or leaves pointer stubs (added 2026-09-02); manual overrides: `BT_WEIGHTS_REPO` (skip EVS), `BT_WEIGHTS_DIR` (local/Kaggle dataset) | size floor 1 MB; a zip that is a plain archive-of-files is rejected |
| libtorch 2.5.1+cu124 | download.pytorch.org | `LIBTORCH_URL` override | none |

| SATRN `best_recog_word_acc_epoch_10.zip` → `recog2/…​.pth` (48 MB; the .zip IS the torch checkpoint, staged by copy) | HF `Ynniss/satrn_small` | `--satrn-attached` | only a 16-hex sha256 **prefix** on record (`9e8f73b300754c35`) |
| PARSeq `parseq_gsr_ft_s1.zip` → `.ckpt` (286 MB; .zip IS the checkpoint, rename not unzip) | HF `Ynniss/final_parseq_jn` (after `--attached`) | none by design (old Drive mirror removed: it served superseded weights) | sha256 reported (`22d93644…`); `audit_parseq.py --stages d1,d2` is the asserting arm + strhub load gate |

Points that contradict a casual reading of the README **[verified]**:

* **Calibration weights are not downloaded from HF by default.** The default path is
  EVS's git-lfs; HF is the fallback/override (`Ynniss/calibiration_weights`). For a Kaggle
  run that must take all weights from HF, either rely on the automatic fallback or set
  `BT_WEIGHTS_REPO=Ynniss/calibiration_weights` explicitly (deterministic, recommended for
  the test run).
* The staged PARSeq path must contain `parseq` and none of `abinet/crnn/trba/trbc/vitstr`
  anywhere in the absolute path (strhub routes the model class on the path string).
* `sports_model.pth.tar-60` was checked/fetched by `preflight_cpu.sh` although nothing
  references it; removed 2026-09-02 after the end-to-end Kaggle run confirmed it unused.
  **[verified]**
* `HF_TOKEN` must be exported if any `Ynniss/*` repo is private; internet must be ON in
  Kaggle notebook settings.

## 5. Dataset expectations [verified]

Layout: `data/SoccerNetGS/<split>/SNGS-*/img1/*.jpg` plus `SNGS-*/Labels-GameState.json`
per sequence (the zips extract with `unzip -o <zip> -d data/SoccerNetGS/<split>`).
Expected sequence counts (from `preflight_cpu.sh`): train 57, valid 59, test 49. Default
run scope: `dataset.nvid: 1`, `eval_set: test`; `dataset.nvid=-1` for the full split;
`dataset.vids_dict.test: ['SNGS-116']`-style pinning selects specific clips — this is the
mechanism for the one-sequence Kaggle test. Server zip layout **[verified on Kaggle]**:
members are `SNGS-XXX/...` at the zip root (36898 members, 49 sequences in `test.zip`).
The HF mirror's internal layout is **[unverified]** (the fallback never triggered); it is
published by the same team and expected identical, and the preflight's `img1`-depth check
would catch a mismatch.

Policy encoded in the repo: `valid` is for tuning sweeps; `test` is reserved for the
frozen production run.

A ready-to-run Kaggle notebook for the one-sequence test (full pipeline incl.
`traj_refine`, the verification chain, and optional detector / refine A/B runs) is at
`docs/kaggle_one_sequence_test.ipynb` (linked from `docs/KAGGLE_GUIDE.md`) **[verified:
nbformat-valid, every bash cell syntax-checked; not yet executed on Kaggle]**.

Reference metrics blocks: tracking (HOTA/DetA/AssA/MOTA/IDF1/IDSW), gsr (GS-HOTA family,
5 m tolerance), jersey_number (Hungarian IoU ≥ 0.5, unnumbered = −1), calibration (JaC5,
JaC10, MRE, MedRE, CR at 960×540). Multiple `--state/--label` pairs produce a comparison
table — the mechanism for per-stage attribution (e.g. with/without `pitch_gate` via
`modules.pitch_gate.cfg.enabled=false`).

Caches that make re-runs cheap: `broadtrack_calib/<seq>.json` (calibration),
`jn_cache/` (jersey, keyed on manifest content + thresholds + both checkpoint digests),
the saved state `outputs/sn-gamestate/<date>/<time>/states/sn-gamestate.pklz`
(`state.load_file` + a truncated `pipeline:` re-runs late stages only), and the
huggingface_hub disk cache.

Kaggle specifics **[verified from scripts/comments]**: root shell with CUDA is available
(no Docker needed); `JN_VENV=/kaggle/tmp/.venv_jn` puts the ~7 GB jersey venv on scratch;
`modules.calibration.cfg.staging_dir` handles the read-only mounted dataset;
`num_cores=0` avoids the cuDNN/torch_shm_manager multiprocessing issue; jersey workers
auto-shard to 2 on 2×T4; `MPLBACKEND` is forced off the inline backend where needed;
`echo "n" |` is piped into `tracklab` by `lightning_eval.sh` (answers an interactive
prompt). `ain_local_path` / `team_local_path` / `BT_WEIGHTS_DIR` / `--*-attached` all
exist so weights can be mounted as Kaggle datasets instead of downloaded per session.

## 7. Known caveats and open items

Stated by the repository itself and confirmed as real caveats **[verified as claims in
code/config comments]**:

1. The DBSCAN operating point (`tracklet_split` eps/min_samples) and `traj_refine`'s
   tau were tuned on embeddings from a notebook export whose producing
   checkpoint cannot be verified from this repository; if it was not the pinned
   OSNet-AIN, they do not transfer and need re-tuning on `valid`.
2. `pitch_gate.margin_m` (3.5), `crop_filter` thresholds, `role_team` params, and
   `interpolation` n_dti/n_min are untuned on this exact pipeline.
3. `team_sha256` and `team_revision` are unset; pin them after the first verified run.
4. SATRN has only a sha256 prefix on record; replace with a full digest once read off a
   verified download.
5. Weight-hash mismatches in the jersey fetchers are reported, not fatal (private
   fine-tunes are legitimate); `audit_parseq.py` and the run audit are the asserting arms.
6. Jersey-stage quality numbers in configs are for ground-truth-box tracklets; no measured
   row exists yet for predicted tracklets through this pipeline.
7. UPDATED 2026-09-04: `traj_refine` `tau` (0.60) is now the pipeline's ONLY merge
   threshold (the splitter never merges). It is inherited from the retired split_merge
   stage's notebook-validated operating point, carried over because the stage uses the
   same embedder pin and distance convention; it is NOT tuned for this stage, and
   tau 0.60 is untuned for this stage. Tune on `valid` if the Kaggle test shows
   over/under-merging.
8. NEW 2026-09-03: the calibration cache `broadtrack_calib/<seq>.json` is keyed by
   sequence name only, and BroadTrack's player masks come from our own detections — a
   cached JSON silently carries the detector that produced it. Reusing it across
   detector variants is deliberate for A/B comparisons (same camera removes a
   confound); a from-scratch production run under a new detector should clear
   `broadtrack_calib/` or override `modules.calibration.cfg.calib_dir`. No audit check
   catches this staleness.
9. NEW 2026-09-03, updated after run 5: run-4 baseline numbers (in-run GS-HOTA 58.4–59.4
   across two sessions on the single sequence test/SNGS-116) were produced with the snft
   detector and WITHOUT `traj_refine`. Run 5 (HM default + traj_refine) scored in-run
   GS-HOTA 55.07 on the same sequence — and since `traj_refine` was a no-op there (see
   run-5 findings below), the drop is attributable to the detector change plus its fresh
   calibration. Evidence is one sequence; **the HM-vs-snft default decision is pending
   the confound-free A/B** (notebook flag `RUN_DET_AB=1`, which reruns snft against the
   session's HM baseline on a shared calibration cache). RESOLVED (batch 13, 2026-09-05): the default detector is set to the HM fine-tune by approved decision, with the calibration cache deliberately REUSED (item 8) so the switch adds no calibration confound; a confound-free A/B on `valid` remains the way to quantify the detector delta.
10. SUPERSEDED (batch 13, 2026-09-05): the 2a/2b two-phase structure this item
    described no longer exists. The five-phase merger re-resolves number
    conflicts to a FIXPOINT before every agglomerative pass and repeats while a
    pass still merges, in phases 1, 3 and 5, so a conflict created by an
    inherited number is resolved on the next pass rather than left standing
    (`refine/traj_refine.py`).

Discrepancies found in this analysis:

11. RESOLVED 2026-09-02: `preflight_cpu.sh` no longer checks/fetches
    `sports_model.pth.tar-60` (was referenced nowhere; confirmed unused by the successful
    end-to-end Kaggle run).
12. RESOLVED 2026-09-02: the README reference-metrics command now locates the newest
    state under `outputs/sn-gamestate/*/*/states/` (TrackLab saves it inside the Hydra run
    directory, confirmed on Kaggle; the old `states/...` root-relative path never exists).
13. NEW 2026-09-04: per-fragment jersey voting. `tracklet_split` emits fragments as the
    tracklets every later stage sees (run-6 log on SNGS-116: 52 tracklets → 67
    fragments), so jersey recognition votes over fewer frames per tracklet (noisier
    votes, potentially more unnumbered tracklets) and processes more tracklets (longer
    jersey worker time). The jersey cache keys on tracklet content, so the first
    post-conformance run recomputes the entire jersey cache. Fragment-level label
    quality on real data is unmeasured.
14. NEW 2026-09-04: stage 3b has no distance cap, by specification — a held
    multi-player detection is placed into the nearest in-scope trajectory whose frame
    is free even at cosine distance ≈ 1; only the absence of any admissible slot
    unassigns it. Verified as spec-faithful in the offline harness; its effect on
    association metrics is unmeasured.
15. UPDATED after batch 7: metrics are comparable ONLY within one architecture state.
    Three states exist: pre-conformance (runs 4–6, split_merge merging label-blind),
    split-only conformance (runs 7–8), and cluster-first (batch 7, no run yet). NO
    metric crosses a state boundary; on top of that, item 19 (calibration
    nondeterminism) invalidates single-run comparisons even within a state when the
    sessions differ. Baselines for the cluster-first architecture must be established
    from scratch.
16. RESOLVED 2026-09-04: the split-vs-merge architecture deviation. The retired
    `split_merge` stage merged fragments on appearance alone, before team and jersey
    evidence existed — contrary to the method, in which Stage 1 only splits and the one
    merge is the label-aware Stage 2. Resolved by the split-only restructuring (§8
    batch 5): `tracklet_split` splits and never merges (audit-enforced), `traj_refine`
    holds the pipeline's one merge plus stage-3 duplicate-frame resolution.
17. RESOLVED 2026-09-04 (found by run 7): a false role_team audit FAIL ("team varies
    within 8 tracks") introduced by stage 3. The role_team check grouped rows by
    `track_id_prerefine` but read the LIVE team column, which `traj_refine`
    legitimately rewrites on rows stage 3b moves between trajectories (adopted rows
    take the target cluster's team) — so role_team's output was no longer what the
    check was reading. The jersey check was immune (it audits the jersey PREREFINE
    snapshots); role happened to stay constant (all moved rows were players). Fix,
    mirroring the jersey design: `traj_refine` now snapshots `role_prerefine`,
    `team_prerefine`, `team_cluster_prerefine` unconditionally, and
    `_check_role_team` audits those when present (recorded in
    `observed.columns_audited`; falls back to the live columns on states without the
    snapshots). Verified by a check-level reproduction test (the exact run-7 message
    without snapshots, PASS with them, genuine role_team variance still FAILs) and by
    the extended `process()` harness (snapshots equal pre-refine values on every row,
    including 3b-moved and unassigned ones). Run 7's metrics remain refused by the
    integrity gate until a rerun passes clean.

Kaggle findings so far (runs 1-3, 2026-09-02): environment recipe, TrackLab patch, and
all 22 stage imports work on the current image (host Python 3.12.13, provisioned 3.9.25);
KAUST served `test.zip` in all three runs (2.8-15.1 MiB/s, so the HF dataset fallback is
justified but untriggered); zip layout is `SNGS-XXX/...` at the root (no split prefix; §5); BroadTrack builds and smoke-tests natively on the
image with weights staged from HF; the jersey stage provisions fully (all four checkpoint
digests verified, `audit_parseq` d1+d2 PASS). Kaggle constraints learned: `/kaggle/working`
is a 20 GB device (dataset zip and `BT_ROOT` belong on `/kaggle/tmp`, with the five
calibration path overrides at run time); Jupyter's `MPLBACKEND` inline backend leaks into
`%%bash` and kills the 3.9 venv's matplotlib import -- `export MPLBACKEND=Agg` for every
venv invocation; GitHub transiently refuses anonymous git-over-HTTPS from shared Kaggle
IPs (hence the source-acquisition hardening above).

Run 4 (2026-09-02, T4 x2): the FULL pipeline completed on test/SNGS-116, exit 0, and
`verify_run_integrity.py` reported RUN INTEGRITY: OK (1 sequence, 0 FAIL, 0 WARN;
1 calibration JSON; 2 jersey cache entries; PARSeq matches upstream). In-run evaluation on
that single sequence: GS-HOTA 58.375 (pitch space, jerseys+teams+roles, 5 m tolerance),
HOTA 58.375, DetA 50.014, AssA 68.136, MOTA 38.393, IDF1 67.818, IDSW 0, MT 13 / PT 8 /
ML 5 of 26 GT ids. A second full session reproduced the run
(in-run GS-HOTA 59.447) and completed the whole verification chain: reference metrics
(tracking HOTA 64.85 / MOTA 86.90 / IDF1 80.57 image-space; GS-HOTA 59.45 pitch; jersey
F1 0.806, trk_acc 0.857; calibration JaC5 0.481, MRE 4.74 px, CR 1.0 over 749/750 frames)
and the BroadTrack conversion check (model equivalence 3.17e-05 px, roundtrip 6.37e-06 m,
both PASS). Single-sequence numbers are not comparable to full-split figures. Full-split
behavior and the HF dataset fallback network path remain unexercised.

Run 5 (2026-09-03, T4 x2, via `docs/kaggle_one_sequence_test.ipynb`, first exercise of
the 2026-09-03 batch): full pipeline on test/SNGS-116 with the HM detector default and
`traj_refine` enabled, exit 0; RUN INTEGRITY: OK — 13 checks PASS, 0 FAIL, 0 WARN,
including the new `traj_refine` check. HM weights loaded through the 3-arg resolver
(`best.zip` → `yolov11l_hm_best.pt`); jersey stage computed fresh under blob schema 2
(2 workers, 15/21 tracklets numbered); fresh calibration from HM detections (CR 749/750,
mean score 0.577 vs 0.647 under snft; conversion checks PASS at 3.70e-05 px /
3.27e-06 m). In-run eval (pitch, attributes on): GS-HOTA 55.07, DetA 46.74, AssA 64.06,
MOTA 30.21, IDF1 64.49, IDSW 0, MT 8 / PT 11 / ML 7 of 26 GT ids, 10200 predicted
detections vs 10567 GT — below the snft baseline across the board (§7 item 9).
`traj_refine` was a NO-OP on this sequence: 23 tracklets in, 23 out, 0 merges,
0 conflicts, 0 rejections, 0 rows relabelled (21 in scope, 15 numbered, all embeddings
valid, img_w read) — split_merge left nothing for it to act on here, so the stage's
merge/conflict behavior on real data remains unmeasured. Both optional A/B cells were
skipped (flags 0). The reference-metrics tables went to the session's
`reference_metrics/summary.md`, not into the notebook output.

Run 6 (2026-09-04 03-33-37, T4 x2, same configuration as run 5 — HM detector,
`traj_refine` enabled, pre-conformance pipeline with `split_merge` still in place): full
pipeline on test/SNGS-116, exit 0, RUN INTEGRITY OK; calibration CR 749/750, mean score
0.583; `traj_refine` again a NO-OP (23 tracklets in, 23 out; inputs 12634 detections /
10361 tracked / 21 in scope / 15 numbered / 21 with team / img_w 1920 / 0 zero
embeddings). The decisive log line: `[split_merge] SNGS-116: 52 tracklets -> 67
fragments (11 split) -> 23 trajectories (39 merges)` — split_merge merged 67 fragments
down to 23 label-blind at the same tau BEFORE team/jersey evidence existed, leaving
`traj_refine` nothing to merge. This run is the direct motivation for the 2026-09-04
split-only restructuring (§7 item 16, §8 batch 5). The in-run evaluation tables were
not in the captured stdout (they went to the session's `reference_metrics/summary.md`,
not retrieved).

Run 7 (2026-09-04 09-05-21, T4 x2, FIRST CONFORMANT RUN — HM detector,
`tracklet_split` + `traj_refine` with stage 3): full pipeline on test/SNGS-116, exit 0.
The splitter: 52 tracklets → 64 fragments (7 split, 187 noise attached, 7 all-multi
dissolved, 7 fragments without a clean detection — left unnumbered by the jersey stage
by design), `_check_tracklet_split` PASS. `traj_refine`, active for the first time:
64 trajectories → 32 (9 2a + 23 2b merges, 1 number conflict resolved, 2 2a pairs
rejected, 3 out of scope; stage 3: 249 held, 249 placed, 0 unassigned), its audit check
PASS. In-run evaluation (pitch, attributes on): GS-HOTA 62.396, DetA 51.93, AssA 74.97,
LocA 70.6, MOTA 44.86, IDF1 70.65, IDSW 4, MT 15 / PT 7 / ML 4 of 26 GT ids, 10200
predicted detections vs 10567 GT, 32 predicted ids — vs pre-conformance run 5 (same HM
detector): AssA 64.06→74.97, MOTA 30.21→44.86, IDF1 64.49→70.65, MT 8→15. HOWEVER the
audit reported PASS=12 FAIL=1 (`role_team: team varies within 8 tracks`) and
`verify_run_integrity.py` correctly refused the run — diagnosed as a stale check
design, not a pipeline defect (§7 item 17), fixed in §8 batch 6. **These metrics are
provisional and unreportable until a rerun passes RUN INTEGRITY OK.** The sidecar-dump,
reference-metrics and conversion-check cells were not executed in that session.

Still **[unverified]** after run 8 and batch 7: any live execution of the
cluster-first pipeline (the batch-7 code is offline-verified only — unit tests,
synthetic harnesses, byte-compares; `tests/test_audit.py` / `tests/test_stages.py`
were adapted by inspection and compile-checked but need the torch environment to
execute); full-split behavior and runtime; the HF dataset fallback's actual network
path (code path tested synthetically; KAUST served `test.zip` again in run 5 at
~15 MiB/s); the EVS git-lfs weights path and its automatic fallback (runs pinned
`BT_WEIGHTS_REPO`); the HF mirror zip's internal layout (§5); the line-by-line
behavior of files verified only at the config/contract level (`broadtrack_api.py`,
the jersey worker); per-fragment jersey quality and runtime under the new eligibility
(referee fragments now enter the workers, and every cache key changes — §7 item 13);
and the cluster quality of `kmeans2_threshold` on real sequences (harness-verified on
synthetic kits only).

18. NEW 2026-09-04 (run 8, the batch-6 rerun): first conformant run with a clean
    integrity chain — exit 0, 13 PASS / 0 WARN / 0 FAIL, RUN INTEGRITY OK,
    `role_team.observed.columns_audited == "prerefine snapshots"`. Every intermediate
    (fragments 52→64, merges 9+23, stage-3 249/249/0, jersey outputs) byte-matched
    run 7. In-run evaluation nonetheless dropped: GS-HOTA 55.732 (run 7: 62.396),
    DetA 44.76, AssA 69.41, MOTA 30.52, IDF1 63.83. Sole pipeline-input difference:
    the BroadTrack calibration was recomputed in the new session (item 19). Run-8
    numbers are the split-only architecture's only integrity-clean data point and are
    superseded by batch 7 (item 15).
19. NEW 2026-09-04 (found by comparing runs 7 and 8): **BroadTrack calibration is
    cross-session nondeterministic and moves GS-HOTA by ~7 points on SNGS-116.**
    Runs 7 and 8 differed ONLY in the recomputed calibration (same weights, same
    inputs, same coverage 749/750; min accepted score 0.494 vs 0.370) yet GS-HOTA
    moved 62.396→55.732 with identical tracking intermediates. Consequences:
    (a) single-run cross-session metric comparisons are INVALID for attribution;
    (b) the only sound A/B method is within-session with a SHARED calibration cache;
    (c) a calibration-freeze option exists — persist `broadtrack_calib/<seq>.json`
    from an accepted run as a Kaggle dataset and mount it (`use_cached_json: true`
    already consumes it) — at the cost of pinning to one calibration draw. The
    detector A/B planned on this basis was dropped from the plan of record (§9).
20. NEW 2026-09-04 (batch 7): cluster-first semantics to keep in mind when reading
    outputs. (a) `team_cluster` is an ANONYMOUS kit id (0/1); left/right exists only
    after `role_team` names the clusters. (b) "Unclustered" is the architecture's
    appearance-outlier notion; the main-referee rule (2.14) selects among unclustered
    trajectories whose sampled y-range stays inside the 0.9-band of the trajectory
    means — with max_i/min_i over the means of ALL trajectories — and requires no
    other movement statistic. (c) An unclustered player's side comes from
    `team_cluster_nearest` (modal per trajectory), a flagged fallback; a no-embedding
    player falls back to its mean-x half (audit WARN).
21. NEW 2026-09-04 (batch 7, harness finding): with unrealistically FEW fragments per
    kit (~3), one kit outlier drags a 2-means centroid enough to evade the robust
    threshold; at realistic sequence sizes (run 8: 64 fragments) the drag is
    negligible and the harness thresholds exactly the referee at 8 fragments/kit.
    A documented property of `kmeans2_threshold`, not a defect; alternative
    `cluster_method` variants (e.g. k=3, outlier pre-filter) can be added behind the
    config switch if real sequences expose it.
22. NEW 2026-09-04 (run 9, the first cluster-first run): the pipeline executed
    end-to-end and every stage behaved as designed — splitter 52→66 fragments;
    team clustering [22, 33] with 11 unclustered (7 no-single + 4 threshold);
    jersey 27/59 numbered (59 = 66 − 7, the new eligibility exactly);
    traj_refine 66→29 (9 2a + 28 2b, 1 conflict resolved; stage 3: 160 held,
    160 placed, 0 unassigned); role_team 25 players + 2 goalkeepers + 2 referees
    with the main referee found by (2.14), left cluster via the quantile cue
    (keeper cue abstained with 2 GKs, by design), 0 fallbacks; 29 predicted vs
    26 GT identities. The run was REFUSED (12 PASS / 1 FAIL): a false FAIL in
    `_check_team_embed` — the check read the live `team_cluster` on the
    pre-refine basis, but traj_refine rewrites it (merged-cluster unification
    → 57 clustered vs the sidecar's 55; 3b row adoption → "varies inside 5
    fragments") — the run-7 mechanism recurring for the cluster column. Fixed
    in batch 8 (snapshot preference; harness-verified). Provisional, refused,
    NOT reportable numbers for expectation-setting only: GS-HOTA 62.111,
    DetA 53.28, AssA 72.42, IDF1 70.36, LocA 91.47 (calibration draw of that
    session applies, item 19).
23. NEW 2026-09-04 (run 10, batch 7+8 code): **RUN INTEGRITY OK — 13 checks, 0 FAIL,
    0 WARN** — the cluster-first architecture's first reportable baseline:
    **GS-HOTA 53.148** (DetA 43.87, AssA 64.40, IDF1 62.77, MOTA 28.17, IDSW 11,
    MT 9, 29 predicted vs 26 GT identities). Every tracking intermediate is
    identical to run 9 (sidecar-verified: 52→66→29, clusters [22, 33], 27/59
    numbered, stage 3 160/160/0, same roles/sides); the metric difference is the
    calibration draw — run 10's was LOW (min accepted score 0.301, mean 0.588,
    586/749 frames ≥ 0.6). The item-19 spread now spans ~9 GS-HOTA points over
    three sessions with identical tracking (run 8: 55.7, run 9: 62.1, run 10:
    53.1), which makes the calibration freeze-vs-shared-cache decision the
    blocking step before any tuning or comparison. Run 10's session also
    demonstrated the output-persistence gap: everything lived under
    /kaggle/working with the repo/venv/dataset, far beyond Kaggle's committed-
    output limits, so nothing persisted — fixed in batch 9 (notebook
    restructure).
24. NEW 2026-09-04 (batch 10): the calibration lottery is FIXED, in two layers.
    (a) BEST-OF-N DRAW SELECTION in the calibration stage: on a cache miss the
    BroadTrack binary now runs `calib_attempts` times (default 3) and the stage
    keeps the attempt with the highest mean line-IoU over accepted frames
    (score >= min_score, acceptance count as tiebreak) — the binary's OWN
    label-free confidence, which predicted GS-HOTA monotonically across runs
    7–10 (0.494 → 62.4, 0.370 → 55.7, 0.301 → 53.1), so the selection is valid
    on the test split; losers are deleted and `<seq>.selection.json` records
    per-attempt stats and the winner (exported by the batch-9 cell).
    `calib_attempts: 1` reproduces the old single-run behavior byte-for-byte.
    This cuts off the left tail that produced runs 8 and 10. (b) FREEZE: the
    notebook's `CALIB_DATASET` variable mounts a Kaggle dataset of
    `broadtrack_calib/*.json` files; they are copied into place before the run
    and `use_cached_json` short-circuits the binary entirely — calibration
    becomes bit-identical across sessions. Workflow: one committed best-of-3
    run generates and persists a high-quality JSON; upload it as a dataset;
    set `CALIB_DATASET`; the ~9-point lottery is first mitigated (a), then
    eliminated (b). Residual [unverified]: the root cause of the binary's
    nondeterminism (not instrumented; the fix removes its effect, not its
    source), and best-of-3's realized draw-quality gain on live sessions.


## 8. Changes made on 2026-09-02, 2026-09-03 and 2026-09-04

Batch 1 (pushed before the Kaggle test; presence in the clone verified by the notebook):

1. `scripts/lightning_eval.sh` — dataset download: SoccerNet server primary, automatic
   fallback to HF `SoccerNet/SN-GSR-2024` on failure/no response/truncated zip; the HF
   zip is unzipped directly from the huggingface_hub cache (no duplicate copy on disk).
2. `preflight_cpu.sh` — same dataset fallback in its fetch phase (non-fatal style,
   matching the script's audit/repair design).
3. `scripts/setup_broadtrack.sh` — BroadTrack weights: EVS git-lfs primary; automatic
   per-file fallback to `BT_WEIGHTS_FALLBACK_REPO` (default `Ynniss/calibiration_weights`)
   when the pull fails or leaves pointer stubs; `BT_WEIGHTS_REPO` / `BT_WEIGHTS_DIR`
   overrides unchanged. Then, after Kaggle run 3 hit GitHub refusing anonymous
   git-over-HTTPS: source-code acquisition hardened (3 clone attempts with
   `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`, codeload-tarball fallback `main`→`master`, optional
   `BT_SRC_FALLBACK_REPO` private HF snapshot).
4. `README.md` — "Download fallbacks" section covering all three behaviors.

Batch 2 (after the test passed; in the local tree, pending the final push):

5. `docs/KAGGLE_GUIDE.md` (new) — verified Kaggle procedure, error guide, timings, and
   the one-sequence reference results; linked from the README.
6. `README.md` — reference-metrics `--state` corrected to locate the newest state under
   `outputs/sn-gamestate/*/*/states/`; link to the Kaggle guide.
7. `preflight_cpu.sh` — unreferenced `sports_model.pth.tar-60` removed from the audit
   and fetch phases.
8. `docs/PIPELINE_REFERENCE.md` (new) — this document, as the repository's canonical
   ground-truth reference.

Batch 3 (2026-09-03, pushed the same day — presence in the clone verified by the run-5
notebook check; all verified offline before the push: unit tests,
plugin self-tests, py_compile, YAML parses, byte-compares of installed copies):

9. `traj_refine` stage: `sn_gamestate/refine/` (new package: `traj_refine.py` algorithm,
   `traj_refine_api.py` stage, `__init__.py`), `configs/modules/traj_refine/
   traj_refine.yaml` (same OSNet-AIN pin as split_merge; tau 0.60, use_reenter true,
   edge_margin 0.02, roles [player, goalkeeper], enabled true), `tests/
   test_traj_refine.py` (18 tests, all passing), wired into `soccernet.yaml`
   (defaults + pipeline between `jersey_number_detect` and `tracklet_agg`) and
   `scripts/preflight_imports.py`.
10. Jersey candidate output, blob **schema 2**: `plugins/jn_gsr/fuse_jn.py`
    (+`pooled_label_stats`, `ranked_candidates`), `jn_recognizer.py` (+`consolidate_full`,
    `predict_full`; `predict` unchanged, delegates), `predict_tracklets.py` (candidates in
    shard results, schema in blob, stub updated); `sn_gamestate/jersey/jn_gsr_api.py`
    (+`jersey_number_candidates`, `jersey_number_maxconf` columns; schema in the cache
    key and enforced on shards and cached blobs). All plugin self-tests pass;
    `plugins/jn_gsr/MANIFEST.sha256` entries for the three edited files regenerated
    (provenance record; consumed by no script — verified).
11. Audit extension: `sn_gamestate/audit/run_audit_api.py` (+`_check_traj_refine`;
    pitch_gate/team_embed/role_team/jersey checks now audit against the pre-refine
    snapshots), `configs/modules/audit/run_audit.yaml` (+`traj_refine_sidecar_dir`,
    `expected_traj_refine` incl. pin equality vs split_merge).
12. Second detector + switch: `configs/modules/bbox_detector/yolo_ultralytics_snft_hm.yaml`
    (new; HF `Ynniss/YOLOv11L_HM` `best.zip`, identical operating point);
    `preflight_cpu.sh` audits/fetches both detector weights; `soccernet.yaml` default
    flipped to `yolo_ultralytics_snft_hm` (the earlier detector stays selectable:
    `modules/bbox_detector=yolo_ultralytics_snft`).
13. `docs/kaggle_one_sequence_test.ipynb` (new) — ready-to-run notebook implementing the
    guide's one-sequence recipe end to end (fail-fast clone check for the pushed files,
    environment gate, single-sequence extraction, full run with the guide's overrides,
    verification chain, traj_refine sidecar summary, optional detector / refine A/B
    cells); linked from `docs/KAGGLE_GUIDE.md`.
14. This document updated to the 2026-09-03 state (§§1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9).

Batch 4 (2026-09-03, after run 5; in the local tree, pending push):

15. `docs/kaggle_one_sequence_test.ipynb` — detector A/B cell repaired: after the
    default flip to HM it selected `yolo_ultralytics_snft_hm` (the default — comparing
    HM to itself). Flag renamed `RUN_HM_AB` → `RUN_DET_AB`; the cell now selects
    `modules/bbox_detector=yolo_ultralytics_snft`, labels `hm` (session baseline) vs
    `snft`, log/output names updated. Revalidated (nbformat schema, `bash -n` per cell).
16. This document updated with the run-5 findings (§§ header, 4, 7, 8, 9).
17. 2026-09-03, algorithm amendment (approved): phase-2a pair ordering changed from the
    sum of the two fragments' maxconf scores to the JOINT pooled maxconf
    `exp(max(mx_F, mx_G))·(conf_sum_F + conf_sum_G)` — the value the merged cluster
    carries, recomputed from the pooled clean-detection statistics (`pair_maxconf`
    helper in `refine/traj_refine.py`; sidecar field `pair_score` → `pair_maxconf`).
    Conflict resolution, merge conditions and 2b unchanged. Tests: 19 (new
    joint-vs-sum ordering case where the two orders differ + helper identity vs
    `combine_cand`); audit unaffected (it never read the ordering field).

Batch 5 (2026-09-04, split-only conformance — approved restructuring to the locked
method specification; in the local tree, pending push; motivated by the run-6 finding,
§7 items 15–16):

18. `tracklet_split` stage (new), replacing `split_merge`:
    `sn_gamestate/track/tracklet_split.py` (split-only algorithm: DBSCAN over ALL
    detections per tracklet, noise → nearest clean-only centroid, per-detection
    dissolution of all-multi fragments, deterministic degenerate cases, tracker-invariant
    validation with fail-fast raise), `tracklet_split_api.py` (stage: same OSNet-AIN
    extraction as the tracker, fragments → trajectories 1..T, `track_id_presplit`
    snapshot, split-only sidecar), `configs/modules/tracklet_split/tracklet_split.yaml`
    (eps 0.2, min_samples 5, same AIN pin, deliberately NO tau),
    `tests/test_tracklet_split.py` (12 tests). `split_merge` retired: its five files
    (`split_merge.py`, `split_merge_api.py`, `split_merge.yaml`, `test_split_merge.py`,
    `notebook_split_merge_reference.py`) moved to `_deleted_pending_git_rm/` with a
    README — run `git rm -r _deleted_pending_git_rm` and remove the empty
    `configs/modules/split_merge/` directory before committing (the editing tools
    cannot delete files).
19. `traj_refine` extended to the locked specification: 2a/2b temporal disjointness now
    over CLEAN frames only (multi-player detections ignored until stage 3; re-enter
    endpoints clean-anchored, fallback to all rows for clean-less fragments); stage 3
    added inside the stage after the merger (3a keep-clean / nearest-multi with a
    counted clean anomaly, all-remaining-detections centroid recompute, 3b greedy
    ascending-distance placement into the nearest in-scope free slot with deterministic
    ties, unassignment when no slot is admissible); driver `-2` bookkeeping sentinel and
    a final all-frames (frame, cluster) collision assertion. `traj_refine_api.py`:
    unassigned rows → `track_id` NaN, rows adopted in 3b take the target cluster's
    labels, self-check `tracked_out == tracked_in − unassigned`, sidecar `stage3` block
    and `rows_unassigned`, log line extended. `tests/test_traj_refine.py`: 22 tests
    (invariant helper skips unassigned rows; three new stage-3 cases).
20. Audit rework: `_check_tracklet_split` replaces `_check_split_merge` (split-only
    assertions — FAIL on any merge threshold or merge/pass evidence, on dropped rows,
    on multi-origin fragments via `track_id_presplit`; fragments-without-clean is a
    recomputed-vs-sidecar consistency check); `_check_traj_refine` row accounting
    (`rows_losing_id == rows_unassigned`, no gained ids, tracked_after == before −
    unassigned) and pin key `ain_sha256_tracklet_split`; tracker-internals pin trio
    renamed; thresholds: `tracklet_split_zero_emb_warn` replaces the two split_merge
    keys. `run_audit.yaml`: `tracklet_split_sidecar_dir`, `expected_tracklet_split`
    (eps, min_samples, ain_sha256 — NO tau), interpolations repointed, header comments
    rewritten.
21. Wiring and reference sweep: `soccernet.yaml` (defaults + pipeline →
    `tracklet_split`, comments), `traj_refine.yaml` comments (tau = the pipeline's only
    merge threshold, inherited from the retired split_merge operating point),
    `scripts/preflight_imports.py` (target → `tracklet_split.split_video`),
    `track/__init__.py`, `botsort_ain.yaml` comment, `tests/README.md`, root `README.md`
    (diagram, stage table incl. a previously missing `traj_refine` row, stage section,
    precision/audit/tuning/layout paragraphs), comment-level references in
    `audit_pipeline_columns.py`, `lightning_eval.sh`, `reference_metrics.py`,
    `build_trt_engines.py`, `inspect_ain_checkpoint.py`;
    `docs/kaggle_one_sequence_test.ipynb` cell-3 fail-fast list extended with the three
    tracklet_split files and a `tracklet_split` grep on `soccernet.yaml`.
22. Verification performed (batch 5): every algorithm/stage/audit file developed and
    tested in a sandbox first; the seven installed Python files byte-identical (sha256)
    to the sandbox-verified copies; both suites re-run from repo copies (22 + 12,
    all passing); every touched Python file compiles; the four YAMLs parsed with
    structural assertions (pipeline order, defaults, expected blocks, no tau on the
    splitter); notebook JSON validated (fail-fast list + zero split_merge strings);
    stubbed `process()` harnesses executed both stage wrappers end to end offline
    (splitter: two-identity split, single-origin fragments, sidecar consistency;
    refiner: 2b merge on clean disjointness, 3a keep-clean, 3b place-when-free and
    unassign-when-blocked, label propagation onto the adopted row, snapshots, row
    accounting); repo-wide reference sweep — the only remaining `split_merge` strings
    in live files are historical-provenance comments marked "retired".

Batch 6 (2026-09-04, after run 7; in the local tree, pending push — the run-7
role_team false-FAIL fix, §7 item 17):

23. `sn_gamestate/refine/traj_refine_api.py`: three snapshot columns written
    unconditionally before any mutation — `role_prerefine`, `team_prerefine`,
    `team_cluster_prerefine` (missing `team_cluster` column → NaN); `output_columns`
    extended; docstring updated.
24. `sn_gamestate/audit/run_audit_api.py` `_check_role_team`: audits the three
    snapshot columns when all are present (on a copied frame — the caller shares
    `tracked_prerefine` with the team_embed and jersey checks), records the source in
    `observed.columns_audited`, falls back to the live columns otherwise (so
    pre-batch-6 states and the synthetic test fixture keep their behavior); check
    description updated.
25. `tests/test_audit.py`: snapshot-preference case appended (live-team flip on a
    multi-row track tolerated through the snapshots, the exact run-7 failure message
    reproduced without them, genuine snapshot-level variance still FAILs).
26. Verification (batch 6): all three installed files byte-identical (sha256) to the
    sandbox-verified copies; `process()` harness extended and green (snapshots equal
    pre-refine values on every row, including the 3b-adopted row — live team "right",
    snapshot "left" — and the unassigned row); a check-level reproduction test green
    (PASS with snapshots / run-7 FAIL message without / genuine variance FAILs / the
    shared frame is not mutated); the untouched suites re-confirmed (22 + 12).

Verification performed per edit (2026-09-02 batches): `bash -n` on every touched script; the zip-validity
fallback trigger exercised against missing/empty/truncated/valid zips (all four correct);
the clone retry→tarball chain exercised with stubs; the codeload endpoint for
`evs-broadcast/BroadTrack` probed live (`main` = HTTP 200); every edited region re-read
in its final on-disk state.

Batch 7 (2026-09-04, the CLUSTER-FIRST restructuring; offline-verified — 26 refine
unit tests, three synthetic harnesses (team clustering, post-refine roles/sides,
refine API), byte-compares of every installed file against the verified sandbox copy,
YAML parses with a pipeline-order assertion; no live run yet):

1. `sn_gamestate/configs/soccernet.yaml` — pipeline reordered to `… crop_filter ->
   calibration -> pitch_gate -> tracklet_split -> team_embed -> jersey_number_detect
   -> traj_refine -> role_team -> …`; header stage table and order rationale
   rewritten.
2. `sn_gamestate/team/team_embed_api.py` — embeds only sampled SINGLE crops per
   fragment; adds the sequence's team clustering (`kmeans2_threshold`: 2-means via
   `rules.kmeans2` + robust MAD threshold, `outlier_k` 3.25) writing `team_cluster`
   and `team_cluster_nearest`; sidecar cluster block. Config
   `configs/modules/team_embed/osnet_team.yaml` gains `cluster_method`/`outlier_k`.
3. `sn_gamestate/team/role_team_api.py` — REPLACED in place: per-trajectory roles and
   sides after `traj_refine` (assistants, goalkeepers with the gk_depth_m 4.0
   confirmation, main referee by rule (2.14) + nearest-to-assistants, cluster→side
   naming via `side_rule: keeper` with the positional keeper cue, nearest-centroid
   and mean-x-half fallbacks). `team/rules.py` untouched — the notebook-equivalence
   test stays valid; `run_sequence` is no longer called by the pipeline.
   `configs/modules/role_team/rules.yaml` rewritten (tau_n 5, tau_a 0.85, tau_a_sy
   3.0, tau_m 0.30, confirm outlier, side_rule keeper, band 0.9, gk_depth_m 4.0;
   DBSCAN/extra-referee/max_ref machinery removed).
4. `sn_gamestate/refine/traj_refine.py` + `traj_refine_api.py` — merge labels are now
   the team CLUSTER id + jersey number (cluster conditions apply only when both
   known; same-cluster different-known-numbers never merge); EVERY fragment in scope
   (roles gone); stage 3b centroids DYNAMIC (recomputed after each assignment);
   role/team snapshots and rewrites removed, `team_cluster_prerefine` kept.
   `tests/test_traj_refine.py`: 4 new tests (cluster veto, unclustered-numbered 2a,
   unclustered-unnumbered 2b, dynamic-3b construction) — 26 total.
   `configs/modules/traj_refine/traj_refine.yaml`: `roles` key removed.
5. `sn_gamestate/jersey/jn_gsr_api.py` — role filter removed; eligibility = at least
   one single crop. `configs/modules/jersey_number_detect/jn_gsr.yaml`: `roles` key
   removed. Every cache key changes (manifest content changed) — one full recompute.
6. `sn_gamestate/pitch_gate/pitch_gate_api.py` — comment/docstring updates only (the
   gate is order-agnostic; it now precedes the splitter).
7. `sn_gamestate/audit/run_audit_api.py` — snapshot-basis map re-derived for the new
   order (§3 audit row); `_check_team_embed` rewritten with clustering validation;
   `_check_role_team` fully replaced (final-trajectory audit, new sidecar schema,
   (2.14)/assistant/keeper caps, fallback consistency); jersey eligibility helpers
   rewritten; traj_refine constancy = number + `team_cluster`; batch-6 snapshot
   machinery retired. `configs/modules/audit/run_audit.yaml`: `expected_team_embed`
   += cluster_method/outlier_k interpolations; `jn_roles` and the refine `roles`
   interpolation removed.
8. `tests/test_audit.py` — adapted: renamed check names, cluster keys in
   `expected_team_embed`, snapshot-preference case replaced by a genuine-variance
   negative control. `tests/test_stages.py` — `per_trajectory` sidecar key.
   `scripts/preflight_imports.py` — one stale comment. Both test files compile;
   execution requires the torch environment (Kaggle preflight gate).

Nothing was retired in batch 7: `role_team_api.py` was replaced in place, all module
paths and Hydra `_target_`s are unchanged, and no `git rm` is needed.

Batch 8 (2026-09-04, after run 9; one file): `sn_gamestate/audit/run_audit_api.py` —
`_check_team_embed` now audits the cluster column from the `team_cluster_prerefine`
snapshot when present (live-column fallback for older states), fixing the run-9
false FAIL (§7 item 22). Verified by a dedicated offline harness that reproduces
run 9's exact pattern (merged-cluster unification + 3b adoption on pre-refine ids:
FAIL on the live column, no FAIL on the snapshot, genuine snapshot variance still
FAILs); installed copy byte-identical to the harness-verified sandbox copy.

Batch 9 (2026-09-04, after run 10; one file, `docs/kaggle_one_sequence_test.ipynb`):
the notebook is restructured for artifact persistence — the repo, venvs, dataset,
caches and run outputs ALL move to `/kaggle/tmp` (they die with the session), and a
new final export cell copies ONLY the artifacts worth keeping to `/kaggle/working`:
`eval_results/` (metrics), `audit/` (verdicts + every stage sidecar), `calibration/`
(the BroadTrack JSON — freeze candidates, §7 items 19/23), `states/*.pklz`,
`video/` (the visualization video the run already renders, ~7.5 min/sequence) and
`jn_cache.zip` — so a committed run (Save & Run All) persists them in the notebook
Output. Verified offline: JSON validity, 26 cells, `bash -n` on every bash cell, and
the export cell executed end-to-end against a synthetic run layout (all seven
artifact groups land, video detection warns when absent); the installed notebook is
cell-for-cell identical to the verified sandbox copy.

Batch 10 (2026-09-04, the calibration fix; §7 item 24): `sn_gamestate/calibration/
broadtrack_api.py` — `_run_binary_best_of` + `_attempt_quality` (best-of-N with
mean-accepted-score selection, selection sidecar, `calib_attempts: 1` == old
behavior); `configs/modules/calibration/broadtrack.yaml` — `calib_attempts: 3` with
the selection rule and its run-7–10 evidence documented;
`docs/kaggle_one_sequence_test.ipynb` — `CALIB_DATASET` configuration variable and
the frozen-calibration mount hook in the run cell. Verified offline: a four-case
harness with a stubbed binary (best-of-3 keeps the highest mean-accepted attempt and
deletes losers with an exact selection sidecar; attempts=1 makes a single call and
no sidecar; a failed attempt is tolerated; all-fail returns False); installed api
byte-identical to the harness-verified copy; notebook JSON valid, hook cells pass
bash -n / py-compile.

Batch 11 (2026-09-05, approved change: "role and team should be computed in final
trajectory"): `sn_gamestate/team/role_team_api.py` — the team clustering is
recomputed on the FINAL trajectories inside `role_team` (per-trajectory
descriptor = L2-normalised median of the trajectory's embedded crops;
`kmeans2_threshold` with `outlier_k` 3.25, mirroring team_embed); the recomputed
`team_cluster`/`team_cluster_nearest` overwrite the columns (constant per final
trajectory); `input_columns` now take `team_embedding` instead of the fragment
labels; `output_columns` gain the two cluster columns; the sidecar gains a
`cluster` block. `configs/modules/role_team/rules.yaml`: params +
`cluster_method`/`outlier_k`, header rewritten. team_embed's fragment clustering
is unchanged and keeps feeding `traj_refine`; the audit needs no change (the
traj_refine constancy check holds — the labels stay constant per final track —
and `_check_team_embed` audits its snapshot since batch 8; `expected_role_team`
interpolates the params, so want == ran stays aligned). Verified offline: a
22-trajectory harness (two 9-strong teams incl. keepers, three distinct-kit
referee outliers thresholded, a no-embedding trajectory → half fallback) checks
the recomputed cluster block, roles, sides, fallback counts and
column-vs-sidecar consistency; installed copy byte-identical (e49f8613);
py_compile; YAML parse. Caveat [unverified]: at trajectory level the referee
party is a larger fraction of the points than at fragment level, and SAME-kit
officials could in principle mass together and evade the MAD threshold (the
harness reproduces this with co-located outliers); real-sequence behavior is
established by the next run.

Batch 12 (2026-09-05, approved change: re-enter on the whole frame width, no
margin): `refine/traj_refine.py` — `edge_side` now returns the frame HALF of
the box center (always defined); `_reenter_ok` therefore always bites for
time-ordered pairs (exit half == entry half required; vacuous only for
interleaved intervals or unknown width); `edge_margin` deleted from the
algorithm signature, the wrapper (`traj_refine_api.py`: cfg read, validation,
log line, sidecar `settings`), `configs/modules/traj_refine/traj_refine.yaml`,
the audit's settings comparison (`run_audit_api.py`: tau only) and the
`expected_traj_refine` interpolation in `run_audit.yaml`. Tests adapted
(`tests/test_traj_refine.py`): `edge_side` half-rule cases; the former
mid-image-vacuous case now asserts the BLOCK and a same-half mid-image merge
added — 26/26 pass against the installed algorithm. Behavioral consequence: a
boundary box mid-frame no longer makes the condition vacuous, so 2b merges
across different halves are now vetoed (stricter than before). All installed
copies byte-identical to the test-verified sandbox copies (traj_refine
37168302, api 5937eaa2, run_audit 4f4626ab); YAML parses.

Batch 13 (2026-09-05, approved change: HM detector default, revised
assistant/side rules, and a five-phase merger): four code files plus configs.

(1) Detector default. `configs/soccernet.yaml` defaults group now selects
`modules/bbox_detector: yolo_ultralytics_snft_hm`; the frozen-baseline
`yolo_ultralytics_snft` stays available via
`modules/bbox_detector=yolo_ultralytics_snft`. The calibration cache is
deliberately REUSED across the switch (§7 items 8-9): BroadTrack's camera is
unchanged, so the change carries no calibration confound. The header comment
and both detector configs' comments were updated to match.

(2) Five-phase merger. `refine/traj_refine.py` — the merger is now FIVE phases
of one identical agglomerative procedure. Fragments are pooled by the labels
they arrive with (S1 cluster+number, S2 cluster only, S3 number only, S4
neither); phases 1-4 merge each pool in isolation and phase 5 pools every
cluster, merged or not, running the procedure once more. The per-pool
conditions are unchanged (clean-frame disjointness, re-enter, cluster and
number agreement each applying only when both sides know the label, distance ≤
tau 0.60). Number-conflict resolution is unchanged in mechanism (lower-maxconf
side walks its candidate list, banned set, exhaustion → unnumbered) and runs in
phases 1, 3 and 5, resolved to a fixpoint before each agglomerative pass and
repeated while the pass still merges. `refine/traj_refine_api.py` — the sidecar
restructures around the five phases: `outputs.merges_by_phase` with keys
"1".."5" replaces `merges_2a`/`merges_2b`/`rejected_2a`, and `record["phases"]`
carries `pools`, `clusters_after_phase`, `merges_by_phase`, `conflicts` and
`conflict_log`; input/output columns and the stage-3 logic are unchanged.
`sn_gamestate/audit/run_audit_api.py` needs NO change: the traj_refine check
reads `outputs.merges`, the `merge_log` finite-distance count, `rows_unassigned`,
`frame_collisions`, `clusters_incoherent`, the OSNet-AIN pin-equality key and
per-track number/`team_cluster` constancy — none of which depends on the phase
breakdown, and the removed `rejected_2a`/conflict fields were only observed,
never asserted. `configs/modules/traj_refine/traj_refine.yaml` header and method
paragraph were rewritten to the five phases; §7 item 10 is superseded.

(3) Role/side rules. `sn_gamestate/team/role_team_api.py` — assistants: `tau_a`
0.85 → 0.9, the y-std cap is now STRICTLY below `tau_a_sy` 2.0, and the
trajectory-length gate `tau_n` is DELETED from the assistant and goalkeeper
masks (the main-referee rule never used it); with several candidates on a side
the one most outlier from both team clusters is kept — largest distance to its
nearer recomputed 2-means centroid, captured as `outlier_d`, ties broken by
\|mean y\| and any no-embedding candidate ranked last via `np.lexsort`. The
side-naming quantile cue is now the mean of the 20th and 80th percentiles of
player mean-x (p20/p80). `configs/modules/role_team/rules.yaml` — `tau_n`
removed, `tau_a` 0.9, `tau_a_sy` 2.0 (documented as a strict bound), comments
updated. `team/rules.py` is untouched.

(4) Config-comment truthfulness. Stale headers that predated the current
pipeline order were corrected in `traj_refine.py`, `traj_refine.yaml` and
`soccernet.yaml`: traj_refine runs after team_embed and jersey and before
role_team, and the merge tracks a team CLUSTER, not a team side.

Verification (offline, source-only): the 26 `tests/test_traj_refine.py` cases
were rewritten for the five phases — phase assertions are integers, pool sizes
are checked, and the `rejected_2a` assertions were replaced — and all 26 pass
under pytest and direct execution against the installed algorithm. A
12-fragment synthetic merger harness confirmed pool isolation in phases 1-4,
every expected merge at the correct phase, a same-number conflict resolved in
phase 3, the clusters-in − merges == clusters-out accounting and run-to-run
determinism; a stubbed-pipeline role_team harness confirmed the most-outlier
per-side selection, the strict y-std cut and the p20/p80 side cue. Every
installed file was copied back and byte-compared against the test-verified
sandbox copy; `py_compile` and YAML parse are clean.

## 9. Plan of record — 2026-09-04, after batch 10 (the calibration fix)

Run 10 delivered the first integrity-clean cluster-first baseline (GS-HOTA 53.148,
§7 item 23) and exposed the ~9-point calibration lottery; batch 10 fixes it (§7 item
24): best-of-3 draw selection on cache miss, plus the `CALIB_DATASET` freeze hook.
Current steps: **(1) push batches 7–10** (nothing retired, plain add/commit/push);
**(2) one committed run (Save & Run All), `CALIB_DATASET` empty** — best-of-3
generates the calibration; expect three `[BroadTrack] ... attempt k/3 mean accepted
score ...` lines, the `kept attempt` line, `calibration/SNGS-116.json` +
`SNGS-116.selection.json` in the Output, 13 PASS, RUN INTEGRITY OK; its metrics are
the first baseline under selected calibration. **(3) Upload the persisted
`calibration/` JSON as a private Kaggle dataset and set `CALIB_DATASET`** — every
subsequent run is then bit-identical in calibration, and cross-session numbers
become directly comparable. After that: pin `team_sha256` (§7 item 3), replace the
SATRN digest prefix (§7 item 4), and tune on `valid` — `traj_refine`
tau (§7 item 7) and the role_team geometry thresholds (§3), carried
from ground-truth-tracklet tuning and untuned on this pipeline's trajectories.
